# Case Study Outline: Baird & Warner — AI Lead Management & Agent Support

## The Hook
**"How Chicago's Oldest Brokerage Could Convert 40% More Leads with AI Response"**

## Company Snapshot
- Baird & Warner (est. 1855 — 170+ years old)
- 2,000+ agents
- Chicago's oldest and one of the largest residential brokerages
- Full service: sales, rental, mortgage, title, property management

## The Problem
Real estate runs on speed-to-lead:
- **Leads go cold fast** — a buyer inquiry unanswered for 30 minutes is often lost
- **Agent availability** — 2,000 agents can't all be available 24/7
- **Lead quality varies** — agents waste time on browsers and tire-kickers
- **Listing marketing** — writing descriptions, scheduling showings, preparing CMAs all take time away from client relationships
- **Transaction coordination** — paperwork-heavy process from contract to close

## The AI Integration
1. **24/7 Lead Response & Qualification** — AI responds to every inquiry within seconds. Asks qualifying questions (timeline, budget, pre-approval status, neighborhood preferences). Routes qualified leads to the best-matched available agent.
2. **Intelligent Lead-Agent Matching** — Beyond round-robin: AI matches leads to agents based on expertise (neighborhood, property type, price range), availability, and conversion history.
3. **Listing Automation** — AI generates property descriptions from MLS data + photos, creates social media posts, and prepares preliminary CMAs from comparable sales.

## Projected Impact
- **Lead response time:** Hours → seconds (24/7)
- **Lead-to-showing conversion:** Up 40% from faster, smarter qualification
- **Agent time on admin:** Down 30% with automated listings and CMAs
- **Qualified lead routing accuracy:** 90%+ match rate (vs. round-robin ~50%)

## Why It's Believable
Real estate is a speed game. Studies consistently show that responding within 5 minutes vs. 30 minutes increases conversion 10x. With 2,000 agents, even a small improvement in lead routing and response time compounds into millions in additional commissions.
