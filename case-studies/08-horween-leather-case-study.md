# Case Study Outline: Horween Leather — AI Order & Customer Service Automation

## The Hook
**"How America's Most Famous Tannery Could Handle 3x More Customer Inquiries Without Hiring"**

## Company Snapshot
- Horween Leather Company (est. 1905, 120+ years)
- 50-150 employees — one of the last tanneries in Chicago
- Makes leather for NFL footballs, Shell Cordovan for premium shoes, Chromexcel for boots
- Serves both enterprise (NFL, major brands) and small craftspeople

## The Problem (Documented)
Horween serves two very different customer types:
- **Enterprise B2B** — NFL, major shoe brands, luxury goods makers. Complex specs, large orders, long relationships.
- **Individual craftspeople** — Small leatherworkers buying small quantities. High volume of questions: "What leather is best for wallets?" "Do you have Shell Cordovan in burgundy?" "What's the difference between Chromexcel and Dublin?"

Same small team handles both. Enterprise accounts need white-glove attention. Craftspeople need answers too — they're passionate, loyal customers. But every "which leather should I use?" question takes time from the team.

## The AI Integration
1. **AI Customer Service for Craftspeople** — Trained on Horween's product catalog, leather specifications, care instructions, and use case recommendations. Handles 80% of product questions instantly. Knows which leathers work for wallets vs. boots vs. bags.
2. **Order Processing for Small Buyers** — Standard orders (popular leathers, common cuts) processed automatically. Inventory checks, pricing, and order confirmation without manual intervention.
3. **Enterprise Account Support** — AI handles routine enterprise inquiries (order status, spec sheets, availability) so the sales team focuses on relationship management and custom projects.

## Projected Impact
- **Customer inquiries handled:** 3x capacity without new hires
- **Small order processing:** 70% fully automated
- **Response time:** Craftspeople get instant answers (vs. waiting for email reply)
- **Sales team time:** 40% more time on enterprise relationships and custom work

## Why It's Believable
Horween's dual-customer challenge is textbook for AI: high-volume routine inquiries from one segment eating into time needed for high-value relationships in another. AI doesn't replace the expertise — it multiplies it.
