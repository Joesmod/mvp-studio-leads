# Case Study Outline: McHugh Construction — AI Document & RFI Management

## The Hook
**"How a 125-Year-Old Chicago GC Could Eliminate Missed RFI Deadlines with AI"**

## Company Snapshot
- James McHugh Construction Co. (est. 1897)
- 500-1,000 employees
- Commercial construction: healthcare, education, high-rise residential, historic renovation
- One of Chicago's most respected general contractors

## The Problem
Large-scale commercial construction generates massive document volumes:
- **RFIs** — hundreds per project, each needing routing to the right person, tracking, and deadline management. A missed RFI response can delay a project at $10K+/day.
- **Change orders** — require documentation, pricing, approvals across multiple parties
- **Subcontractor coordination** — status updates, scheduling, compliance docs across dozens of subs per project
- **Progress reporting** — someone manually compiles data from multiple systems into weekly reports

## The AI Integration
1. **AI RFI Management** — Incoming RFIs parsed, categorized, and auto-routed to the responsible party. Deadline tracking with escalation alerts. AI drafts preliminary responses for standard questions.
2. **Automated Progress Reports** — AI pulls data from project management tools, schedules, and field reports to compile weekly status updates. PM reviews and sends instead of building from scratch.
3. **Subcontractor Communication Hub** — AI handles routine sub inquiries (schedule confirmations, document requests, compliance status) and flags issues that need PM attention.

## Projected Impact
- **Missed RFI deadlines:** 3-4/month → zero (with auto-escalation)
- **Progress report prep:** 4 hrs/week → 30 minutes (review only)
- **Document processing:** 25 hrs/week saved across project teams
- **Subcontractor response time:** 50% faster on routine requests

## Why It's Believable
Construction is famously document-heavy and coordination-intensive. The industry spends billions on project management software but still drowns in RFIs and change orders. AI doesn't replace the PM — it handles the paper chase so PMs can manage the build.
