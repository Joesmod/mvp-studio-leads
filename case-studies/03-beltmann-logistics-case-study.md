# Case Study Outline: Beltmann Logistics — AI Move Coordination

## The Hook
**"How a Century-Old Moving Company Could Cut Estimate Time in Half with AI"**

## Company Snapshot
- Beltmann Moving and Storage (est. ~1927)
- 12 locations nationwide, 200-400 employees
- Corporate relocation, office moves, warehousing
- Agent for North American Van Lines

## The Problem (Documented)
Their site promotes: **"Begin your moving process by scheduling your free moving estimate."** Every move starts with:
- Scheduling an estimate (coordinating across 12 branches)
- On-site or virtual inventory assessment
- Manual pricing based on inventory, distance, timing, special items
- Ongoing customer communication (status, scheduling, changes)
- Multi-vendor coordination for complex corporate relocations

## The AI Integration
1. **AI-Powered Pre-Qualification** — Before an estimator visits, AI guides customers through a detailed virtual intake: room-by-room inventory, special items, access constraints, timing preferences. Estimator arrives already knowing 80% of the job.
2. **Preliminary Estimate Generation** — Based on intake data + historical move data, AI generates a preliminary price range so customers have expectations before the visit
3. **Cross-Branch Scheduling** — AI optimizes estimator and crew scheduling across all 12 locations, reducing dead time and travel

## Projected Impact
- **Estimate prep time:** Cut in half (estimator walks in prepared)
- **Scheduling efficiency:** 25% better crew utilization across branches
- **Customer inquiries:** 60% handled by AI ("Where's my shipment?" "What's included?")
- **Lead qualification:** Filter serious movers from tire-kickers before committing estimator time

## Why It's Believable
Moving is one of the most manual, coordination-heavy services. Every move is custom. But 70% of the questions and 50% of the data gathering are the same every time — perfect for AI.
