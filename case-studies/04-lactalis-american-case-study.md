# Case Study Outline: Lactalis American Group — AI Production & QC Automation

## The Hook
**"How a Global Dairy Giant Could Save $500K/Year with AI Demand Forecasting"**

## Company Snapshot
- Lactalis American Group (parent: Lactalis France, est. 1933)
- 3,700+ employees in Illinois alone
- Brands: Président, Galbani, Parmalat, siggi's, Stonyfield Organic
- Cheese, butter, milk processing at massive scale

## The Problem
Large-scale dairy = perishable products + complex operations:
- **Production scheduling** across multiple facilities, multiple brands, each with different shelf lives
- **Quality documentation** — compliance, batch tracking, audit trails for food safety (FDA, USDA)
- **Demand forecasting** — overproduction = spoilage, underproduction = lost sales. Dairy doesn't wait.
- **B2B order processing** — thousands of retailer/distributor orders with different terms and logistics

## The AI Integration
1. **AI Demand Forecasting** — Model incorporating seasonality, retailer promotional calendars, regional trends, and historical data to predict demand by SKU and facility. Reduce both spoilage and stockouts.
2. **QC Documentation Automation** — AI auto-generates batch reports, compliance documents, and audit trails from production data. Inspectors verify and sign off instead of writing from scratch.
3. **B2B Order Processing** — Routine retailer reorders processed automatically. AI flags anomalies (unusual quantities, new items) for human review.

## Projected Impact
- **Spoilage reduction:** 25-35% from better demand alignment
- **QC documentation time:** 40% faster report generation
- **B2B order processing:** 70% of routine reorders fully automated
- **Annual savings:** $500K+ from reduced waste and labor efficiency

## Why It's Believable
Dairy is the canonical perishable goods problem. Every day a product sits unsold, value drops. AI demand forecasting is one of the highest-ROI applications in food manufacturing — proven across the industry.

## Considerations
- Large corporate structure (French parent) = longer decision cycle
- May have existing enterprise IT — position as enhancement, not replacement
