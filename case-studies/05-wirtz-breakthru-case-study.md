# Case Study Outline: Wirtz/Breakthru Beverage — AI Distribution Optimization

## The Hook
**"How One of America's Largest Beverage Distributors Could Save $1M+ with AI Route Optimization"**

## Company Snapshot
- Breakthru Beverage Illinois (Wirtz Corporation)
- 1,000+ employees in distribution operations
- Wine, spirits, beer wholesale — one of the largest distributors in the US
- Part of the Wirtz empire (Blackhawks, United Center, real estate)

## The Problem (Documented)
Google review: **"They take forever to unload plus they make the drivers wait in the waiting room."** This signals:
- High-volume receiving with scheduling bottlenecks
- Driver wait times = wasted labor hours
- Thousands of daily orders from bars, restaurants, retailers across Illinois
- Route planning still semi-manual — dispatchers rely on experience over data
- Siloed operations (multiple phone numbers for different departments)

## The AI Integration
1. **AI Route Optimization** — Factor in traffic patterns, delivery windows, load weight, driver hours, and customer receiving schedules. Dynamic re-routing when conditions change mid-day.
2. **Order Processing Automation** — Routine reorders from established accounts processed without manual entry. AI detects patterns ("Bar X orders the same case of Maker's Mark every Tuesday") and suggests auto-replenishment.
3. **Receiving Scheduling** — AI coordinates inbound delivery appointments to reduce driver wait times and smooth warehouse throughput.

## Projected Impact
- **Miles driven:** 15-20% reduction through optimized routing
- **Driver wait times:** Cut by 40% with scheduled receiving windows
- **Order processing:** 65% of routine reorders fully automated
- **Annual savings:** $1M+ in fuel, labor, and operational efficiency
- **On-time delivery:** 82% → 95%

## Why It's Believable
Beverage distribution is a route optimization classic. The math is straightforward — even a 10% improvement in routing across a 1,000+ person operation saves serious money. And the driver wait time problem is literally in their public reviews.
