# Case Study Outline: Edsal Manufacturing — AI Quote & Order Processing

## The Hook
**"How a 75-Year-Old Shelving Manufacturer Could Process Quotes 5x Faster with AI"**

## Company Snapshot
- Edsal Manufacturing Company, Chicago IL (est. 1948)
- 200-500 employees
- Metal shelving, storage racks, workbenches — B2B industrial
- Supplies retailers, warehouses, industrial customers

## The Problem (Documented)
Their own website states: **"No direct orders will be placed, only requests for quotes."** Every single sale requires:
- Manual quote creation
- Custom pricing based on configuration (shelving type, dimensions, quantity, finish)
- Back-and-forth on specs
- High-touch process for what could be standard configurations

## The AI Integration
1. **Smart Configuration Intake** — AI-guided form that walks customers through product selection, validates compatibility (e.g., shelf capacity vs. weight requirements), and captures complete specs upfront
2. **Instant Quotes for Standard Configs** — For common configurations (standard shelving sizes, popular workbenches), AI generates quotes instantly from the pricing matrix
3. **Order Validation** — Before anything ships, AI cross-checks order specs against product rules to catch configuration errors

## Projected Impact
- **Standard quote turnaround:** 24-48 hrs → instant for ~60% of requests
- **Order errors:** Down 70% from automated validation
- **Sales team capacity:** Handle 5x more quotes with same staff
- **Customer experience:** Buyers get pricing immediately, close faster

## Why It's Believable
The "no direct orders" policy means every transaction touches a human. That's a bottleneck by design. AI doesn't replace the policy — it makes the process fast enough that customers don't notice.
