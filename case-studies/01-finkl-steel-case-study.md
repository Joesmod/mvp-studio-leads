# Case Study Outline: Finkl Steel — AI-Powered RFQ Automation

## The Hook
**"How a 145-Year-Old Steel Forger Could Cut Quote Turnaround from Days to Hours with AI"**

## Company Snapshot
- A. Finkl & Sons Co. — specialty forging die steels, tool steels, custom open-die forgings
- 500-1,000 employees, 200,000+ tons annual output
- Serves aerospace, automotive, defense, mining, oil & gas
- Part of Swiss Steel Group

## The Problem (Documented)
Finkl published **"Improving the Quoting Process"** in FIA Magazine (Aug 2021) — they openly described their pain:
- RFQ process is manual and slow
- Customers send incomplete information (missing material specs, heat treatment reqs, testing requirements, packaging specs)
- Extensive back-and-forth to gather details
- Quote quality depends entirely on information quality
- Their own words: *"Complete RFQ packages eliminate the need for additional follow up questions and will help suppliers return quotations to you faster."*

## The AI Integration
1. **Intelligent RFQ Intake** — AI parses incoming RFQ emails/forms, extracts key data (material grade, dimensions, heat treatment, testing, volume), and flags what's missing before a human touches it
2. **Automated Follow-Up** — System sends structured requests for missing specs, guiding customers through exactly what's needed (no more generic "please provide more info" emails)
3. **Draft Quote Generation** — Based on historical pricing data, material costs, and specs, AI generates preliminary quotes for standard configurations — engineers review and adjust, not build from scratch

## Projected Impact
- **Quote turnaround:** Days → hours for standard configs
- **Time saved:** ~15-20 hrs/week on RFQ processing and follow-up
- **Completeness rate:** RFQ submissions with all required info up from ~40% to 85%+
- **Sales capacity:** Same team handles 30-40% more quotes

## Why It's Believable
They literally wrote about this problem publicly. The solution maps directly to their stated pain. No speculation needed — this is their own priority.
