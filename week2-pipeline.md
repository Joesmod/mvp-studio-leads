## Notes for Jim
- **Where I wrote "Find via LinkedIn"** — I don't have LinkedIn access. These are real companies where the decision-maker names need to be sourced from LinkedIn Sales Navigator.
- **Email patterns:** Most mid-size companies use firstname@company.com or first.last@company.com. Try both.
- **Priority order:** I'd send to Testa, Vienna Beef, Eli's, and Reliable Fire first — they're the best combo of right size, clear pain point, and findable contacts.
