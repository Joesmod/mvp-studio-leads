## AI Integration Consulting Pitch

**Industry:** Logistics / Specialized Freight
**Location:** St. Cloud, MN
**Estimated Size:** 2,500+ employees, $800M+ revenue

## Company Overview
Anderson Trucking Service (ATS) is a major specialized and flatbed carrier operating across the US. They handle heavy haul, oversized loads, and specialized freight requiring permits and route planning. Also offer logistics brokerage services.

## Pain Points
- Complex route planning for oversized/overweight loads requiring permits
- Permit acquisition is manual and state-by-state
- Equipment matching — right trailer type for each specialized load
- Brokerage margin optimization across thousands of carrier relationships

## Proposed AI Solution
**AI-Powered Specialized Load Planning & Permit Automation**
- Automated permit research and application across state DOTs for oversize loads
- Intelligent equipment matching based on load specs, trailer availability, and driver location
- Route optimization for heavy haul considering bridge weight limits, road restrictions, and clearances
- Brokerage pricing engine using historical lane data and market conditions

## Estimated Impact
- 60% reduction in permit processing time
- Better equipment utilization through smarter matching
- 5-8% margin improvement on brokerage loads

## Outreach Strategy
Target VP of Operations or Director of Specialized Services. The permit automation angle is unique and immediately resonant — every specialized carrier hates the manual permit process.
