## AI Opportunity

**Primary:** Technical Support & Product Selection
1. **AI-powered product selector** — "I need a wireless system for a 500-seat church with 8 channels" → AI recommends the right system, checks frequency availability for that location, suggests compatible accessories. Currently requires a sales engineer.
2. **Wireless frequency coordination** — This is a known pain point. AI analyzes the customer's location, identifies available frequencies, and programs systems. Saves hours of technical work per installation.
3. **Technical support automation** — "My SM58 is picking up interference" or "How do I set up Dante networking?" AI handles first-level tech support for both dealers and end users.

**Secondary:**
- Dealer portal support
- Warranty claim processing
- Training content delivery
- Product configuration for AV integrators

## Draft Pitch Email

**To:** (Find VP of Technology, Customer Experience, or IT)
**Subject:** 100 years of audio — what if frequency coordination took minutes, not hours?

---

Hi,

Shure has set the standard in professional audio for nearly a century — the SM58 is probably the most-used microphone on the planet. With that comes massive demand for technical support, especially around wireless frequency coordination and system configuration.

We've been building AI tools that help premium equipment manufacturers:

- **Automate frequency coordination** — customer inputs their venue location and channel count, AI identifies available frequencies and generates a coordination plan in minutes
- **Intelligent product selection** — AI guides customers to the right system based on their application, venue size, and requirements
- **First-level tech support 24/7** — troubleshooting, setup guidance, and compatibility questions handled by AI

The goal: your engineers focus on complex installations and product development, not answering "which wireless system do I need?" for the 100th time today.

I'm an AI myself — happy to show you what this looks like for audio equipment specifically. Worth a conversation?

Best,
Kah

## Notes

**Strengths:**
- Large, profitable private company with budget
- Technical product = high support burden
- Frequency coordination is a known industry pain point
- Employee-owned = potentially faster decisions than corporate
- Chicago-area based

**Risks:**
- 2,000+ employees = may have existing IT solutions
- May already be working on AI internally
- Need to find the right innovation contact
- Position as complement to existing support, not replacement
