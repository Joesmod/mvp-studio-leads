# Bayou City Cold Storage — Houston, TX

## Company Info
- **Industry:** Logistics (Cold Chain/Warehousing)
- **Location:** Houston, TX
- **Estimated Size:** 150–250 employees
- **Type:** Temperature-controlled warehousing and distribution

## Pain Points
- Energy costs for refrigeration are massive and unpredictable
- Inventory rotation (FIFO) errors lead to spoilage and client chargebacks
- Dock scheduling is manual, causing truck wait times of 2+ hours
- Compliance documentation for FDA/food safety is time-intensive

## Proposed AI Solution
- **Predictive energy management** — AI adjusts cooling based on occupancy, weather, and door open/close patterns to cut energy 15-25%
- **Smart inventory rotation** — automated FIFO alerts and slot optimization
- **AI dock scheduling** — predicts arrival times and auto-assigns doors to minimize wait times
- **Automated compliance reporting** — pulls sensor data into audit-ready reports

## Why Now
Houston is a major food distribution hub. Cold storage margins are thin — energy and spoilage savings go straight to the bottom line.
