## AI Use Case: Deal Sourcing & Investment Analysis Automation

### Pain Points
- Brokers manually comb public records and listing databases for off-market opportunities
- Investment analysis (cap rate, NOI projections) done in spreadsheets per deal
- Market reports assembled manually from multiple data sources
- Client matching to properties is relationship-driven with no systematic scoring

### Proposed Solution
AI deal sourcing tool that monitors public records, permits, and ownership changes to identify likely sellers. Automated investment analysis engine that generates pro forma financials from property data. Client-property matching algorithm based on investment criteria, risk profile, and portfolio gaps.

### Expected Impact
- 3x increase in off-market deal pipeline
- 60% reduction in time spent on financial modeling per deal
- Better client-property matching leading to faster close rates
