## AI Integration Consulting Pitch

**Industry:** Construction (Design-Build)
**Location:** Dallas, TX (South Central regional office)
**Estimated Size:** 4,000+ employees
**Website:** henselphelps.com

## Pain Points
- RFI (Request for Information) processing on large projects is slow and creates bottlenecks
- Subcontractor prequalification and selection is manual and inconsistent
- Document management across projects generates thousands of unstructured files

## Proposed AI Solution
- **AI RFI Router**: Automatically classify, prioritize, and route RFIs to the right team members, with draft responses generated from project docs
- **Subcontractor Intelligence Platform**: AI scoring of subcontractor bids using historical performance, safety records, and financial health data
- **Smart Document Search**: AI-powered search across all project documents with natural language queries — find any spec, drawing note, or email in seconds

## Value Proposition
Accelerate RFI turnaround by 60%, make better subcontractor selections with data, and eliminate hours of document hunting per project manager per week.

## Contact Strategy
Target: Regional VP or Director of Innovation
