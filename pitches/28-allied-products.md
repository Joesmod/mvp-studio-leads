## Company Profile

**Name:** Allied Products Corporation
**Location:** Chicago, IL
**Website:** alliedproductscorp.com
**Industry:** Industrial Equipment Manufacturing
**Employees:** Est. 100-300

---

## What They Do

Manufactures heavy industrial equipment:
- Stamping presses
- Metalworking machinery
- Material handling equipment
- Custom industrial equipment

B2B only — serves automotive, appliance, aerospace, and general manufacturing.

---

## Key Finding 🎯

Heavy industrial equipment manufacturing has intense service/parts requirements:
- Machines have 20-30 year lifespans — ongoing service and parts over decades
- Customers need parts for machines built years ago
- Field service coordination (technicians traveling to customer factories)
- Preventive maintenance scheduling
- Technical documentation for complex machinery
- Spare parts inventory management (thousands of part numbers across product generations)

---

## AI Opportunity

**Primary:** Service & Parts Automation
1. **Parts identification & ordering** — Customer calls: "I need the hydraulic seal for my 1998 Verson 600-ton press." AI identifies the exact part from machine serial number, checks inventory, and processes the order. Currently requires a service engineer.
2. **Preventive maintenance scheduling** — AI tracks installed base, calculates maintenance intervals, and proactively contacts customers when service is due.
3. **Technical support** — AI answers first-level technical questions from maintenance techs at customer factories: troubleshooting, adjustment procedures, safety checks.

**Secondary:**
- Field service scheduling and dispatch
- Custom equipment quoting
- Documentation search (manuals, schematics across decades of products)

## Draft Pitch Email

**To:** (Find Service Director or VP Operations)
**Subject:** When a customer needs parts for a press from 1998 — what if AI could find it instantly?

Hi,

Allied Products builds heavy machinery that lasts decades — which means your service team supports an installed base spanning generations of products. When a customer calls needing a part for a 20-year-old press, someone has to cross-reference serial numbers, find the right schematic, identify the part, check inventory, and process the order.

We've been building AI tools for industrial equipment manufacturers:

- **Instant parts identification** — customer provides serial number or describes the issue, AI identifies the exact part, checks availability, and processes the order
- **Proactive maintenance outreach** — AI tracks your installed base and contacts customers when preventive maintenance is due
- **First-level tech support** — troubleshooting guidance, adjustment procedures, and safety checks for maintenance techs

The goal: your service engineers focus on complex problems, not parts lookup.

I'm an AI myself — happy to demonstrate. Worth a quick call?

Best,
Kah

## Notes

**Strengths:**
- Long machine lifespans = decades of service revenue potential
- Parts identification is a clear, high-value AI use case
- Traditional manufacturing, Chicago-based
- Installed base support is recurring revenue

**Risks:**
- Smaller company = limited budget
- May be very traditional/conservative
- Need to demonstrate quick ROI
