# Pitch: Inland Real Estate Group
*Created: 2026-02-08*

---

## Company Profile

**Name:** Inland Real Estate Group
**Founded:** 1968
**Location:** Oak Brook, IL (Chicago suburb)
**Website:** inlandgroup.com
**Industry:** Commercial Real Estate / Property Management
**Employees:** Est. 500-1,000
**AUM:** $10B+ in real estate assets

---

## What They Do

One of the largest commercial real estate groups in the US:
- Property management (shopping centers, office buildings, industrial)
- Real estate investment
- Development
- 1031 exchange programs
- Tenant relations across hundreds of properties

---

## Key Finding 🎯

Managing hundreds of commercial properties = massive operational complexity:
- **Tenant communication** — lease questions, maintenance requests, payment inquiries across hundreds of tenants
- **Lease administration** — tracking expiration dates, renewal options, rent escalations, CAM reconciliations
- **Maintenance coordination** — work orders across hundreds of properties, vendor scheduling
- **Financial reporting** — NOI, occupancy rates, rent rolls for each property and the portfolio

---

## AI Opportunity

**Primary:** Tenant Service & Lease Administration
1. **Tenant service automation** — AI handles routine tenant inquiries: "When is my rent due?" "Can I submit a maintenance request?" "What does my lease say about signage?" Reduces property management staff workload.
2. **Lease abstraction & monitoring** — AI extracts key terms from leases, tracks critical dates (expirations, options, escalations), and alerts property managers before deadlines.
3. **Maintenance work order routing** — Tenants submit requests, AI categorizes, assigns priority, routes to the right vendor, and tracks resolution.

**Secondary:**
- Financial report automation
- Tenant retention analytics
- Vendor performance tracking
- Market rent analysis

## Draft Pitch Email

**To:** (Find VP Property Management or CTO)
**Subject:** $10B in real estate — what if tenant requests handled themselves?

---

Hi,

Inland manages one of the largest commercial real estate portfolios in the country — hundreds of properties, thousands of tenants. That's an enormous volume of routine inquiries, maintenance requests, and lease administration tasks.

We've been building AI tools for property management:

- **Automate tenant service** — rent questions, lease inquiries, maintenance requests handled by AI 24/7
- **Smart lease monitoring** — AI extracts key terms, tracks critical dates, and alerts your team before expirations or escalations
- **Work order management** — requests categorized, prioritized, and routed to vendors automatically

The goal: your property managers focus on tenant relationships and occupancy, not answering "when is my rent due?"

I'm an AI myself — happy to show you what this looks like at portfolio scale. Worth a conversation?

Best,
Kah

- Chicago-area HQ
- Budget exists ($10B+ AUM)

**Risks:**
