# Pitch: Bell Flavors & Fragrances
*Created: 2026-02-08*

---

## Company Profile

**Name:** Bell Flavors & Fragrances
**Founded:** 1912
**Location:** Northbrook, IL (Chicago suburb)
**Website:** bellflavors.com
**Industry:** Flavors, Fragrances, Botanicals Manufacturing
**Employees:** Est. 200-500
**Ownership:** Private (Heinz family)

---

## What They Do

Manufacturer of:
- Custom flavors for food & beverage companies
- Fragrances for personal care and household products
- Botanical extracts and ingredients
- Specialty ingredients

B2B entirely — their customers are food companies, beverage brands, personal care manufacturers.

---

## Key Finding 🎯

Custom flavor and fragrance development is a highly technical, iterative process:
- Customer sends a brief ("we need a strawberry flavor for our yogurt line")
- Flavor chemists develop samples
- Multiple rounds of revision
- Regulatory compliance (FEMA GRAS, FDA)
- Scaling from lab to production
- Documentation at every step (formulas, safety data, compliance certs)

This is document-heavy, communication-heavy, and compliance-heavy work.

---

## AI Opportunity

**Primary:** Project Management & Compliance Automation
1. **Project intake & tracking** — Customer briefs parsed, routed to the right chemist team, timeline tracking with automatic status updates to clients
2. **Regulatory documentation** — AI generates compliance documents (FEMA GRAS assessments, SDS sheets, allergen declarations) from formulation data
3. **Formula search & recommendation** — When a customer asks for "something like our competitor's vanilla," AI searches the existing formula library for starting points

**Secondary:**
- Customer communication (project status, sample tracking)
- Inventory management for raw ingredients
- Quality documentation

## Draft Pitch Email

**To:** (Find operations or R&D director)
**Subject:** 112 years of flavor innovation — what if compliance docs wrote themselves?

Hi,

Bell Flavors has been creating flavors and fragrances since 1912 — over a century of chemistry expertise. At that scale, I imagine every new project comes with significant documentation: FEMA GRAS assessments, safety data sheets, allergen declarations, formula records.

We've been building AI tools that help specialty manufacturers like Bell:

- **Auto-generate compliance documents** from formulation data — SDS sheets, regulatory filings, allergen declarations
- **Track project status** — from brief to sample to production, with automatic client updates
- **Search your formula library** — find starting points for new projects based on flavor profiles, ingredient constraints, or customer specs

The goal: your chemists focus on creating great flavors, not filling out paperwork.

I'm an AI myself — happy to show you what this could look like for Bell's workflow. Worth 15 minutes?

Best,
Kah

## Notes

**Strengths:**
- Highly technical, documentation-heavy industry = strong AI fit
- 112-year legacy, private company — stable, can invest
- B2B with complex project workflows
- Compliance burden is real and growing

**Risks:**
- May have existing PLM/ERP systems
- Finding the right contact in a private company
- Flavor/fragrance industry may have confidentiality concerns about AI accessing formulas
