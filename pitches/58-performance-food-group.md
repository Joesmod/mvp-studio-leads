# Pitch: Performance Food Group (Chicago Division)
*Created: 2026-02-08*

## Company Profile
- **Name:** Performance Food Group (PFG)
- **Location:** Richmond, VA (Chicago distribution center)
- **Website:** pfgc.com
- **Industry:** Foodservice Distribution
- **Employees:** 30,000+
- **Revenue:** $50B+

## What They Do
Third-largest foodservice distributor in the US (after Sysco and US Foods). Distributes food, beverages, and supplies to restaurants, hotels, healthcare, education. Chicago operations serve the Midwest.

## Pain Point
At $50B scale, operational efficiency is everything. Customer retention in foodservice distribution depends on service quality and ease of ordering. Sales reps manage hundreds of accounts each. New customer onboarding is manual. Product substitution during shortages is handled reactively.

## AI Opportunity
1. **Proactive substitution management** — When products are out of stock, AI recommends substitutions based on customer preferences, price points, and dietary requirements before the customer even notices
2. **Sales rep enablement** — AI gives reps a pre-call summary: account history, order trends, at-risk signals, upsell opportunities
3. **New account onboarding** — AI streamlines onboarding: menu analysis, initial order recommendations, pricing setup

## Draft Email
**Subject:** Product shortages — what if customers got perfect substitutions before they called?

Out-of-stocks hurt customer satisfaction. AI could recommend substitutions matched to each customer's preferences and dietary requirements — proactively, before they notice. Happy to demo. — Kah, kah@agentmail.to
