# Pitch: World's Finest Chocolate
*Created: 2026-02-08*

---

## Company Profile

**Name:** World's Finest Chocolate, Inc.
**Founded:** 1939
**Location:** Chicago, IL (South Side)
**Website:** worldsfinestchocolate.com
**Industry:** Chocolate Manufacturing / Fundraising
**Employees:** Est. 200-500
**Ownership:** Private (Robinson family)

---

## What They Do

A unique business model:
- Manufactures chocolate bars, almonds, caramels, mints
- **Primary channel: fundraising** — supplies schools, churches, sports teams, scouts with chocolate bars to sell
- Also sells direct-to-consumer and retail
- Their factory on the South Side produces millions of chocolate bars annually

---

## Key Finding 🎯

The fundraising model creates unique operational complexity:
- **Thousands of fundraising organizations** ordering at different times (school year cycles, seasonal events)
- Each order is relatively small but there are thousands of them
- **Custom packaging** — many organizations want their name/logo on the box
- **Seasonal demand** — school fundraising peaks in fall and spring
- **Customer service volume** — fundraising coordinators (often parent volunteers) need lots of hand-holding
- Returns/exchanges when organizations over-order

This is a high-touch, high-volume, small-order business.

## AI Opportunity

**Primary:** Fundraiser Order Management & Customer Service
1. **Fundraiser setup automation** — When a school or church starts a fundraiser, AI handles: order calculation (how many bars for X students), custom packaging specs, delivery scheduling, and payment terms. Currently this probably requires a sales rep.
2. **Customer service for coordinators** — Parent volunteers running school fundraisers ask the same questions: "How do I return unsold boxes?" "When will my order arrive?" "Can I add more to my order?" AI handles 80%+ of these.
3. **Demand forecasting by season** — Predict school fundraiser volume by region and season to optimize production scheduling.

**Secondary:**
- Returns processing automation
- Fundraiser performance analytics (help organizations sell better)
- Reorder automation for repeat fundraiser organizations

## Draft Pitch Email

**To:** (Find VP Sales or Operations)
**Subject:** Millions of chocolate bars for millions of fundraisers — what if setup took 5 minutes?

Hi,

World's Finest Chocolate has powered American fundraising for over 80 years — every school, church, and scout troop knows those chocolate bars. That's an incredible position, and it comes with unique challenges: thousands of small organizations, each needing setup, order calculation, custom packaging, and lots of support from volunteers who do this once a year.

We've been building AI tools that help high-volume B2B operations like yours:

- **Automate fundraiser setup** — organization enters their details, AI calculates order size, handles packaging specs, sets delivery dates, and generates materials
- **Support fundraiser coordinators 24/7** — "How do I return unsold boxes?" "When does my order ship?" "Can I increase my order?" answered instantly
- **Forecast seasonal demand** — predict fall and spring fundraiser volume by region to optimize your production line

The goal: your sales team focuses on landing new organizations, not hand-holding existing ones through setup.

I'm an AI myself — happy to show you what this could look like. Worth a quick conversation?

Best,
Kah
