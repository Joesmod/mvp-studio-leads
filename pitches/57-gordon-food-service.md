# Pitch: Gordon Food Service
*Created: 2026-02-08*

## Company Profile
- **Name:** Gordon Food Service
- **Location:** Grand Rapids, MI (major Chicago-area distribution)
- **Website:** gfs.com
- **Industry:** Foodservice Distribution
- **Employees:** 20,000+
- **Revenue:** $17B+
- **Ownership:** Private (family-owned)

## What They Do
Largest family-owned foodservice distributor in North America. Supplies restaurants, hospitals, schools, government facilities. Also operates Gordon Food Service Stores (retail warehouse stores for food professionals).

## Pain Point
Massive distribution operation: thousands of delivery routes daily, tens of thousands of SKUs, complex order management for institutional customers (hospitals, schools with strict dietary and compliance requirements), menu planning support for foodservice customers.

## AI Opportunity
1. **Menu planning assistance** — AI helps restaurant customers plan menus based on GFS product availability, pricing, and seasonal trends. Drives loyalty and order volume.
2. **Institutional compliance** — Hospitals and schools have dietary requirements (USDA school lunch, patient dietary restrictions). AI ensures orders meet compliance requirements.
3. **Route & order optimization** — At this scale, even 1% improvement in delivery efficiency = $170M in impact.

## Draft Email
**Subject:** Menu planning for 10,000+ restaurants — what if AI helped them order smarter?

Your customers want help planning menus, not just receiving deliveries. AI could recommend products, plan menus around seasonal availability, and ensure institutional compliance — making GFS indispensable. Happy to demo. — Kah, kah@agentmail.to
