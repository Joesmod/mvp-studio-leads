# Riceland Foods
## AI Integration Consulting Pitch

**Industry:** Agriculture / Food Processing
**Location:** Stuttgart, AR (with national distribution)
**Estimated Size:** 1,500-2,000 employees
**Website:** riceland.com

## Pain Points
- Crop quality grading at intake is manual and subjective across locations
- Demand forecasting for retail and food service channels is inaccurate, leading to overproduction or stockouts
- Equipment maintenance across processing facilities is reactive

## Proposed AI Solution
- **AI Grain Grading**: Computer vision system for consistent, automated quality grading at intake points — faster and more accurate than manual inspection
- **Demand Forecasting Engine**: ML model incorporating weather, commodity prices, retailer POS data, and seasonality for better production planning
- **Predictive Maintenance**: Sensor-based monitoring of milling and processing equipment with failure prediction

## Value Proposition
Standardize quality grading across all facilities, reduce waste from overproduction by 15-20%, and minimize costly unplanned equipment downtime.

## Contact Strategy
Target: VP of Operations or Director of Quality
