# Pitch: Reinhart Foodservice
*Created: 2026-02-08*

## Company Profile
- **Name:** Reinhart Foodservice (Performance Food Group company)
- **Location:** Multiple Midwest distribution centers (serves Chicago)
- **Website:** rfreinhart.com
- **Industry:** Foodservice Distribution
- **Employees:** Est. 5,000+
- **Parent:** Performance Food Group

## What They Do
Major Midwest foodservice distributor: full-line food and non-food products for restaurants, healthcare, education, hospitality. Multi-temp distribution (frozen, refrigerated, dry). Custom cutting and portioning.

## Pain Point
Full-line foodservice distribution: managing tens of thousands of SKUs across temperature zones, customer-specific pricing and programs, new restaurant onboarding, product knowledge for sales reps (thousands of products to know), food safety and traceability.

## AI Opportunity
1. **Sales rep product knowledge** — AI gives reps instant answers: "What's a good substitute for brand X chicken breast?" "What's the allergen info on this item?" "What's my customer's margin on this product?"
2. **Customer onboarding** — New restaurant opens → AI analyzes their menu, recommends initial product list, sets up pricing, and generates first order suggestion
3. **Food safety traceability** — AI tracks lot numbers from receiving through delivery, enables instant recall response

## Draft Email
**Subject:** New restaurant opens — what if their first order built itself from the menu?

Onboarding a new restaurant customer means analyzing their menu and recommending products from thousands of SKUs. AI could do that analysis instantly and generate a starter order. Happy to demo. — Kah, kah@agentmail.to
