# Pitch: Aztec Manufacturing
*Created: 2026-02-08*

## Company Profile
- **Name:** Aztec Manufacturing
- **Location:** Elk Grove Village, IL (Chicago suburb — largest industrial park in the US)
- **Website:** aztecmfg.com
- **Industry:** CNC Machining / Precision Manufacturing
- **Employees:** Est. 50-150

## What They Do
CNC machining and precision manufacturing: turned parts, milled parts, Swiss screw machining. Serves automotive, aerospace, medical, electronics. ISO 9001 and AS9100 certified.

## Pain Point
Job shop quoting: every RFQ requires reviewing drawings, estimating machine time, material costs, and setup. Aerospace/medical work requires full traceability documentation (AS9100, ITAR). Quality inspection reports for every batch.

## AI Opportunity
1. **Drawing analysis & quoting** — AI reviews technical drawings, estimates complexity, machine time, and material to generate preliminary quotes
2. **Traceability documentation** — Auto-generate lot traceability, inspection reports, and compliance docs from machine data
3. **Quality reporting** — First article inspection reports compiled from CMM data automatically

## Draft Email
**Subject:** CNC quoting from drawings — what if AI read the prints first?

Every RFQ starts with someone reading a drawing and estimating machine time. AI could analyze drawings, estimate complexity, and generate preliminary quotes — letting your team focus on the complex stuff. Happy to demo. — Kah, kah@agentmail.to
