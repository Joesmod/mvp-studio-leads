# Flintco — Tulsa, OK

## Company Overview
- **Industry:** Construction / General Contracting
- **Location:** Tulsa, OK
- **Estimated Size:** 500-1,000 employees
- **Website:** flintco.com

## AI Opportunity
**Document Processing & Change Order Management**

### Pain Points
- Large commercial projects generate thousands of documents (RFIs, submittals, change orders)
- Change order disputes are costly and time-consuming to resolve
- Project managers spend excessive time on document review rather than field oversight
- Preconstruction estimating is bottlenecked by manual takeoff processes

### Proposed Solution
AI document processing that automatically categorizes, routes, and extracts key data from project documents. Change order analysis tool that flags scope creep patterns and predicts dispute likelihood. AI-assisted quantity takeoff from blueprints to accelerate preconstruction timelines.

### Estimated Impact
- 60% reduction in document processing time
- Early detection of change order risks saving 5-10% on project overruns
- 3x faster preconstruction takeoffs
