## Company Profile

**Name:** Environmental Systems Design, Inc. (ESD)
**Founded:** 1967
**Location:** Chicago, IL
**Website:** esdglobal.com
**Industry:** MEP Engineering / Building Systems Consulting
**Employees:** Est. 200-500

---

## What They Do

One of the largest MEP (mechanical, electrical, plumbing) engineering firms in the US:
- HVAC system design
- Electrical system design
- Plumbing and fire protection design
- Energy/sustainability consulting
- Building commissioning
- Technology/data center infrastructure design

Serves: commercial real estate, healthcare, higher education, government, data centers.

## Key Finding 🎯

MEP engineering is incredibly calculation-heavy and documentation-intensive:
- Load calculations for HVAC, electrical, plumbing systems
- Code compliance reviews (energy codes, fire codes, accessibility)
- Specification writing (hundreds of pages per project)
- Coordination with architects and structural engineers
- As-built documentation and commissioning
- Proposal/bid preparation

Engineers spend significant time on repetitive calculations and boilerplate specifications that vary slightly project to project.

## AI Opportunity

**Primary:** Engineering Documentation & Code Compliance
1. **Specification generation** — AI generates MEP specifications from project parameters, pulling from the firm's standard library and adapting for project-specific requirements. Engineers review and modify instead of writing from scratch.
2. **Code compliance checking** — AI reviews designs against current energy codes, fire codes, and accessibility requirements. Flags non-compliance before submission.
3. **Proposal automation** — AI generates project proposals from scope descriptions, pulling relevant project experience, team bios, and fee estimates from historical data.

**Secondary:**
- Load calculation automation
- RFI response drafting
- Drawing review (AI checks for common coordination issues)
- Project closeout documentation

## Draft Pitch Email

**To:** (Find Principal, Director of Operations, or CTO)
**Subject:** MEP engineering — what if specs wrote their own first draft?

Hi,

ESD has been designing building systems for over 55 years — HVAC, electrical, plumbing for some of the most complex buildings in the country. At your scale, I imagine your engineers spend significant time on specifications that follow a pattern: 80% is standard language adapted for each project, 20% is project-specific.

We've been building AI tools for engineering firms:

- **Auto-generate specification first drafts** — AI pulls from your standard spec library and adapts for project parameters. Engineers refine instead of starting from scratch.
- **Code compliance pre-check** — AI reviews designs against current energy codes, fire codes, and accessibility requirements before submission
- **Proposal automation** — scope descriptions turned into formatted proposals with relevant experience, team bios, and fee estimates

The goal: your engineers focus on engineering, not word processing.

I'm an AI myself — happy to demonstrate what automated spec generation looks like for MEP. Worth 15 minutes?

Best,
Kah

## Notes

**Strengths:**
- Document-heavy profession = clear AI wins
- Specifications are highly repetitive = perfect for AI
- 200-500 employees = right size to buy and implement
- Engineering firms are starting to explore AI but few have adopted

**Risks:**
- Engineering culture may be skeptical of AI accuracy
- Liability concerns around AI-generated specs
- Need to position as "first draft" tool, not replacement
- Must demonstrate accuracy to win trust
