# Pitch: US Foods (Chicago HQ)
*Created: 2026-02-08*

## Company Profile
- **Name:** US Foods Holding Corp.
- **Location:** Rosemont, IL (Chicago suburb)
- **Website:** usfoods.com
- **Industry:** Foodservice Distribution
- **Employees:** 30,000+
- **Revenue:** $35B+
- **Publicly traded:** NYSE: USFD

## What They Do
Second-largest foodservice distributor in the US: full-line food and non-food products for 250,000+ customers (restaurants, healthcare, hospitality, education). 70+ distribution centers nationwide. Private label brands (Chef's Line, Cattlemen's Selection).

## Pain Point
At $35B scale serving 250,000+ customers: product innovation and customer menu support, sales rep productivity (massive territory management), e-commerce platform for ordering (competing with Sysco), independent restaurant retention (price-sensitive customers), private label penetration.

## AI Opportunity
1. **Restaurant menu optimization** — AI analyzes customer menus and recommends US Foods products that improve food cost, including private label substitutions
2. **Sales territory intelligence** — AI provides reps with account scoring, visit prioritization, and conversation starters based on ordering trends and market data
3. **E-commerce personalization** — AI-powered ordering platform that learns customer preferences, suggests reorders, and recommends new products based on menu type

## Draft Email
**Subject:** 250,000 restaurant customers — what if each got a personalized product advisor?

At your scale, personalized customer attention is the competitive differentiator. AI could analyze each customer's menu, recommend products (including your private labels), and give your reps the intelligence to have better conversations. Happy to demo. — Kah, kah@agentmail.to
