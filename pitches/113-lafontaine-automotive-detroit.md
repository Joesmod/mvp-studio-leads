## AI Use Case: Customer Lifecycle Management & Service Optimization

### Pain Points
- Lead follow-up is inconsistent across locations — hot leads go cold
- Service department scheduling is manual, leading to bay underutilization
- Inventory aging — certain models sit on lots too long while others sell out fast

2. **Service Bay Optimizer** — Predict appointment no-shows, optimize tech assignments, and suggest upsell opportunities based on vehicle history
3. **Inventory Intelligence** — ML model to recommend optimal stock mix per location based on local demand patterns, seasonality, and competitive pricing
4. **Retention Engine** — Automated lifecycle campaigns triggered by mileage milestones, warranty expiration, and market value of trade-in
