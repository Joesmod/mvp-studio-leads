# Intermountain Trucking Co — Boise, ID

## Company Overview
- **Industry:** Logistics / Freight Transportation
- **Location:** Boise, ID
- **Estimated Size:** 200–350 employees
- **Fleet:** 150+ trucks serving Pacific Northwest and Mountain West

## Pain Points
- Load matching done manually by brokers calling shippers — trucks run empty 25% of miles
- Driver retention is a constant problem — no early warning system for at-risk drivers
- Fuel costs are second-largest expense but route fuel optimization is minimal
- Compliance with ELD/HOS regulations tracked reactively — violations discovered after the fact

## Proposed AI Solution
- **AI load matching and backhaul optimization:** Predict available loads along routes and auto-match to reduce deadhead miles
- **Driver retention predictor:** Analyze driver behavior patterns (miles, home time, pay, complaints) to flag at-risk drivers before they quit
- **Fuel optimization engine:** AI-optimized routing factoring fuel prices by location, terrain, weight, and weather for minimum fuel cost per mile
- **Proactive compliance monitoring:** Real-time HOS tracking with AI alerts before violations occur, plus automated DVIR processing

## Value Proposition
Reduce empty miles by 30%, cut driver turnover by 20%, and save $0.03/mile on fuel costs fleet-wide.

## Contact Research
- TBD — needs VP of Operations or fleet manager contact
