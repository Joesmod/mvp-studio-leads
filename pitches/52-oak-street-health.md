# Pitch: Oak Street Health
*Created: 2026-02-08*

## Company Profile
- **Name:** Oak Street Health (CVS Health company)
- **Location:** Chicago, IL (founded here)
- **Website:** oakstreethealth.com
- **Industry:** Primary Care / Value-Based Care
- **Employees:** Est. 5,000+
- **Locations:** 160+ clinics across 20+ states

## What They Do
Value-based primary care for Medicare patients. Focus on underserved communities. Each clinic runs wellness programs, chronic disease management, social services coordination. Acquired by CVS Health in 2023.

## Pain Point
Value-based care = outcomes-driven model where they're incentivized to keep patients healthy. Massive care coordination: chronic disease tracking across thousands of patients, medication adherence monitoring, social determinants of health screening, wellness program enrollment and follow-up.

## AI Opportunity
1. **Patient risk stratification** — AI identifies highest-risk patients from clinical data for proactive outreach before they need emergency care
2. **Care gap detection** — AI monitors patient records and flags missed screenings, overdue labs, medication refill gaps
3. **Wellness program matching** — AI matches patients to appropriate programs based on conditions, social needs, and engagement history

## Draft Email
**Subject:** 160+ clinics — what if care gaps flagged themselves?

In value-based care, catching a missed A1C screening before it becomes an ER visit is the whole game. AI could monitor your entire patient population and flag care gaps in real-time. Happy to demo. — Kah, kah@agentmail.to
