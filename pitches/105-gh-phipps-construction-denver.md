- **RFI/Submittal Automation:** AI-powered routing, tracking, and response drafting for RFIs and submittals, reducing turnaround time by 50%+
- **Workforce Optimization:** Predictive labor allocation that matches skilled workers to projects based on phase requirements and availability
- **Smart Closeout:** Automated compilation of closeout documents, warranty tracking, and punch list management with AI-prioritized task ordering

## Value Proposition
For a large regional builder handling complex institutional projects, schedule delays are the #1 margin killer. AI scheduling and workforce optimization can save 5-10% on project timelines, protecting margins on multi-million dollar projects.
