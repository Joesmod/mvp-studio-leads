# Bailey Construction — Little Rock, AR

## Company Overview
- **Industry:** Commercial Construction (Entertainment/Theater)
- **Location:** Little Rock, Arkansas
- **Estimated Size:** 200-400 employees
- **Revenue:** ~$102M (2019)
- **Website:** baileyconstruction.com

## AI Opportunity
**Multi-state project tracking and subcontractor management**

## Pain Points
- Projects spanning multiple states (AR, TX, MA, MS) with different regulations
- Specialized entertainment venue construction requires precise timeline management

- Permit and regulatory compliance varying by jurisdiction

## Proposed Solution
AI-powered project coordination system that:
