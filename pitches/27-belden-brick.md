## Key Finding 🎯

Brick manufacturing + architectural specification is a niche with specific pain points:
- **Architects specify brick** by color, texture, size — hundreds of options. Choosing the right brick requires samples, consultations, and technical guidance.
- **Custom orders** — special shapes, colors, and sizes for architectural projects take weeks to quote and produce.
- **Sample management** — architects request samples constantly. Tracking, shipping, and following up on samples is labor-intensive.
- **Project specification support** — architects need help writing brick specifications for their projects.

## AI Opportunity

**Primary:** Architect Support & Sample Management
1. **AI product selector** — Architect describes their vision ("warm earth tones, tumbled texture, modular size for a craftsman-style facade") → AI recommends specific brick products, shows examples in similar projects, and provides spec sheets.
2. **Sample request automation** — AI processes sample requests, tracks shipments, automates follow-ups ("Did you receive the samples?" "Ready to specify?"), and routes hot leads to sales reps.
3. **Specification writing** — AI generates brick specification sections for architectural projects, formatted to CSI standards, based on the selected products.

**Secondary:**
- Project estimating (brick quantity calculations)
- Technical support (installation guidance, mortar compatibility)
- Custom order quoting

Hi,

Belden Brick has been manufacturing premium brick for 140 years — five generations of craftsmanship. Your product range is massive: hundreds of colors, textures, and sizes. That's a strength, but it also means architects spend significant time finding the right brick for their project.

We've been building AI tools that help building product manufacturers:

- **Intelligent product selection** — architect describes their vision, AI recommends specific products with examples from similar projects
- **Automate sample management** — requests processed instantly, shipments tracked, follow-ups automated
- **Generate brick specifications** — CSI-formatted spec sections ready for the architect to drop into their project documents

The goal: make it easy for architects to specify Belden. The easier you are to work with, the more they specify your product.

I'm an AI myself — happy to show you what this could look like. Worth a quick conversation?

Best,
Kah
