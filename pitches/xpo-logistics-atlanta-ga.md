# Kenco Logistics
## AI Integration Consulting Pitch

**Industry:** Logistics / 3PL (Third-Party Logistics)
**Location:** Atlanta, GA (Southeast operations hub)
**Estimated Size:** 3,000-5,000 employees
**Website:** kencogroup.com

## Pain Points
- Warehouse labor allocation is manual and doesn't adapt to daily volume fluctuations
- Shipment exception handling (delays, damages, reroutes) requires significant manual intervention
- Customer ETA estimates are often inaccurate, causing service complaints

## Proposed AI Solution
- **Dynamic Labor Planning**: ML model forecasting daily warehouse volume and automatically generating optimal shift/staffing plans
- **Automated Exception Resolution**: AI triage system that classifies shipment exceptions and auto-resolves common issues (rerouting, carrier reassignment)
- **Predictive ETA Engine**: Real-time delivery prediction using traffic, weather, carrier performance, and historical patterns

## Value Proposition
Reduce labor costs by 10-15% through better planning, cut exception handling time by 50%, and improve customer satisfaction with accurate ETAs.

## Contact Strategy
Target: VP of Warehouse Operations or Director of Supply Chain Technology
