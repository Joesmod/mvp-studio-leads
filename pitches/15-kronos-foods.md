# Pitch: Kronos Foods
*Created: 2026-02-08*

---

## Company Profile

**Name:** Kronos Foods, Inc.
**Founded:** 1975
**Location:** Glendale Heights, IL (Chicago suburb)
**Website:** kronosfoods.com
**Industry:** Food Manufacturing (Mediterranean)
**Employees:** 200+
**Notable:** Largest manufacturer of gyros in the world

---

## What They Do

Mediterranean food manufacturing:
- Gyro cones (their flagship — they standardized the product)
- Greek yogurt
- Pita bread
- Hummus
- Spanakopita, baklava
- Other Mediterranean foods

B2B foodservice — supplies restaurants, food trucks, grocery stores, caterers.

---

## Key Finding 🎯

They went from a single product (gyro cones) to a full Mediterranean food line. That expansion means:
- Multiple production lines with different requirements (meat processing, dairy, baking, prepared foods)
- Complex production scheduling across diverse products
- Different quality/compliance requirements per product type
- B2B customers ordering across the full product line
- Growing product complexity with a team built for simpler operations

---

## AI Opportunity

**Primary:** Multi-Line Production & Order Optimization
1. **Production scheduling across product lines** — Gyros, yogurt, pita, and prepared foods have completely different production processes. AI optimizes scheduling across all lines to minimize changeover waste and maximize throughput.
2. **Order processing & bundling** — Restaurants ordering gyro cones often also need pita and tzatziki. AI suggests bundle opportunities and processes multi-product orders efficiently.
3. **Demand forecasting by product** — Each product has different demand patterns. AI forecasts at the SKU level to reduce waste (especially on perishables like yogurt and hummus).

**Secondary:**
- Quality compliance documentation across product categories
- New product launch planning (demand estimation)
- Customer service for foodservice accounts

## Draft Pitch Email

**To:** (Find operations director or VP)
**Subject:** World's largest gyro maker — what if production scheduling optimized itself?

Hi,

Kronos went from inventing the manufactured gyro cone to building a full Mediterranean food empire — gyros, yogurt, pita, hummus, and more. That's impressive growth, and I imagine it came with growing complexity.

Running multiple production lines — meat processing, dairy, baking, prepared foods — each with different requirements, timelines, and compliance rules is a scheduling puzzle. Add in forecasting demand across all those product categories, and it's a full-time job just to optimize throughput.

We've been building AI tools that help multi-product food manufacturers:

- **Optimize production scheduling** across different lines — minimize changeover, maximize throughput
- **Forecast demand by SKU** — especially critical for perishables like yogurt and hummus
- **Process multi-product orders** efficiently — with smart bundling suggestions for foodservice accounts

The goal: less waste, better throughput, and orders that don't need manual intervention.

I'm an AI myself — happy to walk through what this could look like for Kronos's operation. Worth a conversation?

Best,
Kah
