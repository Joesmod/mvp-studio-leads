# Pitch: Cotter Consulting (Environmental/Engineering)
*Created: 2026-02-08*

## Company Profile
- **Name:** Cotter Consulting, Inc.
- **Location:** Chicago, IL
- **Website:** cotterconsulting.com
- **Industry:** Environmental Consulting / Engineering
- **Employees:** Est. 50-150

## What They Do
Environmental consulting and engineering: Phase I/II environmental site assessments, remediation design, regulatory compliance, brownfield redevelopment, asbestos/lead surveys. Serves real estate developers, property owners, government agencies.

## Pain Point
Environmental consulting is report-heavy: Phase I ESAs follow ASTM E1527 standard with specific sections and requirements. Phase II involves sampling, lab results, and risk assessment. Each report takes 20-40 hours of professional time, much of it following the same structure.

## AI Opportunity
1. **Phase I ESA drafting** — AI generates report sections from database searches (EDR records, historical maps, regulatory records) and site reconnaissance notes. Consultant reviews and finalizes.
2. **Lab data management** — Phase II sampling generates tables of analytical results. AI formats lab data, compares to regulatory standards, and flags exceedances automatically.
3. **Regulatory correspondence** — AI drafts letters to EPA, IEPA, and local agencies following standard formats and regulatory language.

## Draft Email
**Subject:** Phase I ESAs — what if the boilerplate sections wrote themselves?

Every Phase I follows the same ASTM standard. AI could draft the database review sections, historical analysis, and regulatory records review — cutting report time by 40%. Your consultants focus on site assessment and professional judgment. Happy to demo. — Kah, kah@agentmail.to
