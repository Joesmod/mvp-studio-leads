# Great Lakes Bakery — Detroit, MI

## Company Info
- **Industry:** Food & Beverage (Commercial Bakery)
- **Location:** Detroit, MI
- **Estimated Size:** 90–150 employees
- **Type:** Wholesale bakery supplying grocery and foodservice

## Pain Points
- Production planning relies on historical averages, leading to overproduction waste or stockouts
- Ingredient ordering is manual and doesn't account for demand variability
- Quality consistency across shifts varies — no real-time monitoring
- Route delivery scheduling is static and doesn't adapt to daily order changes

## Proposed AI Solution
- **Demand forecasting** — ML models predict orders by SKU/customer using weather, day-of-week, seasonality, and promotions
- **Automated procurement** — AI generates ingredient orders based on forecasted production, lead times, and price optimization
- **Production quality monitoring** — sensor-based AI tracks oven temps, mix times, and product dimensions for consistency
- **Dynamic route optimization** — daily delivery routes recalculated based on actual orders, traffic, and truck capacity

## Why Now
Food waste is a margin killer for bakeries. Even 10% improvement in forecast accuracy can save 5-8% on ingredient costs.
