# Pitch: Heritage-Crystal Clean
*Created: 2026-02-08*

## Company Profile
- **Name:** Heritage-Crystal Clean, LLC
- **Location:** Elgin, IL (Chicago suburb)
- **Website:** crystal-clean.com
- **Industry:** Environmental Services / Industrial Waste Management
- **Employees:** Est. 3,000+
- **Revenue:** $700M+

## What They Do
Industrial waste management and environmental services: parts cleaning, used oil collection, waste disposal, field services, antifreeze recycling. Route-based service model — trucks visit thousands of customers on recurring schedules.

## Pain Point
Route-based environmental services at this scale: thousands of customers on recurring service schedules, each with different waste types, pickup frequencies, and regulatory requirements. Manifests, waste tracking, and EPA compliance for every pickup.

## AI Opportunity
1. **Route optimization** — AI optimizes service routes across thousands of stops, factoring in waste type, container fill levels, regulatory deadlines, and geography
2. **Manifest automation** — Waste manifests generated from service data, tracked from pickup through disposal, with regulatory reporting automated
3. **Customer service** — "When is my next pickup?" "Can I add a waste stream?" "What's my disposal certificate?" handled by AI

## Draft Email
**Subject:** Thousands of service routes — what if scheduling optimized itself?

Route optimization across thousands of industrial waste customers, plus manifest tracking and EPA compliance. AI could optimize routes, auto-generate manifests, and handle customer inquiries. At your scale, even 5% route efficiency = millions saved. Happy to demo. — Kah, kah@agentmail.to
