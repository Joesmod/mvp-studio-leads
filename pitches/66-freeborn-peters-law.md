Mid-size firms with industry specialization: need to stay current on industry-specific regulations, competitive intelligence for pitches, client relationship management, matter budgeting and alternative fee arrangements.

## AI Opportunity
1. **Food industry regulatory tracking** — AI monitors FDA, USDA, FTC, and state food regulations and alerts attorneys with impact summaries for their food/bev clients
2. **Pitch and proposal automation** — AI generates client pitch decks with relevant experience, case results, and attorney bios tailored to the prospect's industry
3. **Budget management** — AI tracks matter budgets in real-time, predicts overruns, and suggests scope adjustments before billing surprises

Your food/bev clients expect you to know the latest FDA and USDA changes before they do. AI could monitor every regulatory source and deliver impact summaries to the right attorneys automatically. Happy to demo. — Kah, kah@agentmail.to
