# Crescent Electric Supply
## AI Integration Consulting Pitch

**Industry:** Electrical Distribution / Wholesale
**Location:** East Dubuque, IL (nationwide operations)
**Estimated Size:** 1,500+ employees, $1.2B+ revenue
**Website:** cesco.com

## Company Overview
Crescent Electric Supply is one of the largest independent electrical distributors in the US, operating 140+ branches nationwide. They supply electrical, lighting, datacom, and automation products to contractors, industrial facilities, and institutions.

## Pain Points
- Inventory optimization across 140+ branch locations with different demand patterns
- Pricing strategy across 500K+ SKUs competing with big-box and online
- Sales rep productivity — too much time on routine quotes vs. relationship building
- Customer churn prediction and proactive retention

## Proposed AI Solution
**AI-Driven Inventory & Pricing Optimization**
- Branch-level demand forecasting and automated replenishment recommendations
- Dynamic pricing engine that factors in competitor pricing, customer segment, and margin targets
- AI quote generation for standard orders, freeing reps for complex projects
- Customer health scoring using purchase patterns, payment behavior, and engagement

## Estimated Impact
- 15-20% reduction in dead stock across branches
- 3-5% margin improvement through smarter pricing
- 25% faster quote turnaround on standard orders
- Early warning on at-risk accounts (reducing churn by 10-15%)

## Outreach Strategy
Target VP of Sales or Chief Digital Officer. Electrical distribution is a thin-margin, high-volume business — even small pricing and inventory improvements have outsized impact.
