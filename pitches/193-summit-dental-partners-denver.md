# Summit Dental Partners — Denver, CO

## Company Info
- **Industry:** Healthcare Admin (Dental Group Practice)
- **Location:** Denver, CO
- **Estimated Size:** 60–100 employees across 8 locations
- **Type:** Multi-location dental practice management

## Pain Points
- Patient no-shows cost $200+ per empty chair hour across 8 locations
- Insurance verification and claims processing is manual, 3-5 hours daily per office
- Scheduling across locations is uncoordinated — some offices overbooked while others have gaps
- Treatment plan follow-up falls through the cracks

## Proposed AI Solution
- **Predictive no-show model** — identifies high-risk appointments and auto-sends targeted reminders or fills slots from waitlist
- **AI insurance verification** — auto-checks eligibility and estimates patient costs before visits
- **Cross-location scheduling optimization** — balances patient load across all 8 offices
- **Automated treatment follow-up** — AI sequences outreach for patients with incomplete treatment plans

## Why Now
Dental group practices are consolidating fast. Operational efficiency is the difference between profitable growth and overhead bloat.
