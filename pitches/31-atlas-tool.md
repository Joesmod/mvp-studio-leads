## Company Profile

**Name:** Atlas Tool & Die Works
**Founded:** 1918
**Location:** Chicago, IL (Lyons, IL)
**Website:** atlastool.com
**Industry:** Tool & Die / Precision Stamping
**Employees:** Est. 100-300
**Ownership:** Private

---

## What They Do

Precision metal stamping and tool & die manufacturing:
- Progressive dies
- Metal stampings (automotive, appliance, electronics)
- Assembly services
- Secondary operations (welding, riveting, tapping)
- Prototype to production runs

---

## Key Finding 🎯

Tool & die shops live and die on quoting speed and accuracy:
- **RFQ volume** — constant stream of quote requests with drawings and specs
- **Quote accuracy** — underquote and you lose money, overquote and you lose the job
- **Die design** — complex engineering that starts fresh for each project
- **Quality documentation** — PPAP (production part approval process) for automotive customers
- **Machine scheduling** — multiple jobs across dozens of presses with different tonnages/capabilities

---

## AI Opportunity

**Primary:** RFQ Processing & Job Scheduling
1. **AI-assisted quoting** — Parse customer drawings/specs, estimate material costs, press time, and tooling complexity from historical job data. Generate preliminary quotes in hours instead of days.
2. **Production scheduling** — Optimize job sequencing across presses based on tonnage requirements, die changeover time, and delivery deadlines.
3. **PPAP documentation** — Auto-generate production part approval packages from inspection data and process parameters.

**Secondary:**
- Quality inspection reporting
- Machine utilization tracking
- Customer communication (order status, delivery updates)
- Predictive maintenance for presses

## Draft Pitch Email

**To:** (Find owner or operations manager)
**Subject:** 100+ years of precision — what if quotes came back in hours, not days?

Hi,

Atlas Tool has been delivering precision stampings since 1918 — over a century of tooling expertise. In this business, quoting speed matters: customers send RFQs to multiple shops, and the first accurate quote often wins.

We've been building AI tools for job shops and stampers:

- **Faster quoting** — AI analyzes drawings and specs, pulls from historical job data to estimate material, press time, and tooling costs. Preliminary quote in hours.
- **Smarter scheduling** — optimize job sequencing across your presses based on tonnage, changeover time, and delivery dates
- **PPAP automation** — generate documentation packages from inspection data without manual compilation

The goal: quote faster, schedule smarter, document automatically.

I'm an AI myself — happy to show you what this looks like for a stamping operation. Worth a quick call?

Best,
Kah

## Notes

**Strengths:**
- Classic job shop with clear quoting pain point
- PPAP documentation is universally hated in automotive supply chain
- Century-old company, privately owned
- Chicago-area

**Risks:**
- Smaller company = limited budget
- Very traditional — may resist tech
- Need to prove quoting accuracy
