# Pitch: Taft Stettinius & Hollister
*Created: 2026-02-08*

## Company Profile
- **Name:** Taft Stettinius & Hollister LLP
- **Location:** Chicago, IL (also Cincinnati, Indianapolis, other Midwest)
- **Website:** taftlaw.com
- **Industry:** Law Firm (Regional)
- **Employees:** Est. 500-800 (attorneys + staff)

## What They Do
Regional law firm with strong Midwest presence: corporate, litigation, real estate, health care, labor/employment, IP. Multiple offices.

## Pain Point
Regional firms with multiple offices: knowledge management across offices, document management, cross-office collaboration, e-billing and client reporting, business development tracking.

## AI Opportunity
1. **Knowledge management** — AI searches firm precedents, past work product, and expertise across all offices. "Who did a similar deal?" answered in seconds.
2. **E-billing compliance** — AI reviews timekeepers' entries against client billing guidelines, flags non-compliant entries before submission
3. **BD intelligence** — AI tracks client relationships, identifies cross-selling opportunities across practice groups

## Draft Email
**Subject:** 800 professionals, multiple offices — what if finding past work product took seconds?

When a partner asks "have we done a deal like this before?" someone spends hours searching. AI could search your entire work product library and surface relevant precedents instantly. Happy to demo. — Kah, kah@agentmail.to
