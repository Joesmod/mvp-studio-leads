# Park Place Dealerships
## Luxury Auto Dealer Group | Dallas, TX

**Industry:** Automotive Retail
**Estimated Size:** 1,500+ employees, 16 dealerships
**Website:** parkplace.com

### Pain Points
- High-touch luxury customer experience requires personalized follow-ups at scale
- Service scheduling and parts ordering across multiple luxury brands (Mercedes, Porsche, Lexus, etc.)
- Sales team spends hours on manual CRM data entry instead of selling

### Proposed AI Solution
AI **customer concierge system** — automated but personalized service reminders, purchase anniversary touchpoints, and trade-in timing alerts based on mileage/lease data. AI-assisted CRM that auto-logs interactions and suggests next-best-actions for sales reps.

### Why Now
Luxury auto retail is all about the relationship. AI that enhances (not replaces) the personal touch is a perfect fit.

**Contact:** TBD — needs verification
