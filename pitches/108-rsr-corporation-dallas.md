# RSR Corporation
## Lead Battery Recycling / Manufacturing | Dallas, TX

**Industry:** Manufacturing / Recycling
**Location:** Dallas, Texas (facilities in IN, NY, CA)
**Estimated Size:** 200-500 employees, multi-facility
**Website:** rsrcorporation.com

## Pain Points
- Environmental compliance monitoring across multiple states requires constant attention
- Lead processing yields vary by battery condition with limited predictive capability
- Equipment maintenance is reactive, causing unplanned downtime
- Material intake grading and pricing is manual and inconsistent across facilities

## Proposed AI Solution
- **Environmental Compliance Dashboard:** AI-monitored emissions and waste tracking with predictive alerts before limits are approached, auto-generated regulatory reports
- **Yield Prediction AI:** ML models that predict lead recovery rates based on incoming battery characteristics, optimizing processing parameters
- **Predictive Maintenance:** Sensor-driven AI that predicts equipment failures before they happen, scheduling maintenance during planned downtime
- **Automated Intake Grading:** Computer vision and weight-based AI system for consistent battery grading and pricing across all facilities

## Value Proposition
In lead recycling, yield optimization and uptime are directly tied to profitability. AI-driven predictive maintenance alone can reduce unplanned downtime by 30-50%. Consistent grading across facilities eliminates pricing disputes and improves supplier relationships.
