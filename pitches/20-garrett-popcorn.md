---

## Key Finding 🎯

Garrett operates across multiple channels with very different needs:
- **Retail shops** — in-store production, inventory, staffing
- **E-commerce** — online orders, perishable shipping logistics, gift packaging
- **Corporate gifting** — large seasonal orders, custom packaging, bulk pricing
- **International** — customs, shipping, shelf life challenges

Corporate gifting is likely their highest-margin, most complex channel:
- Holiday season = massive order spike
- Custom branding/packaging
- Delivery coordination to hundreds of corporate addresses
- Repeat business year over year

---

## AI Opportunity

**Primary:** Corporate Gifting & E-Commerce Automation
1. **Corporate gift order management** — AI handles recurring corporate accounts: remembers last year's order, suggests quantities based on employee count changes, processes custom packaging specs, coordinates delivery to multiple addresses.
2. **E-commerce customer service** — "Where's my order?" "Can I change my delivery date?" "Do you ship to Hawaii?" "What's the shelf life?" AI handles 80%+ of inquiries.
3. **Demand forecasting** — Holiday corporate gifting spikes are somewhat predictable. AI forecasts production needs by product and channel weeks ahead.

**Secondary:**
- Retail shop inventory optimization
- International order compliance (customs documentation)
- Customer retention (re-engagement campaigns for past corporate buyers)

## Draft Pitch Email

**To:** (Find VP Operations or E-commerce director)
**Subject:** Holiday gifting rush — what if Garrett's corporate orders managed themselves?

Hi,

Garrett Popcorn is a Chicago treasure — and I imagine the holiday gifting season is both your biggest revenue opportunity and biggest operational challenge. Corporate clients ordering hundreds of tins, each with custom packaging, multiple ship-to addresses, and tight delivery deadlines.

We've been building AI tools that help specialty food brands with multi-channel operations:

- **Automate corporate gift orders** — AI remembers last year's order, suggests updates, processes custom packaging, coordinates multi-address delivery
- **Handle customer service 24/7** — order tracking, shipping questions, product info for both corporate and DTC customers
- **Forecast holiday demand** — predict production needs by product and channel so you're staffed and stocked before the rush

The goal: your team focuses on making incredible popcorn and building relationships, not processing orders and answering shipping questions.

I'm an AI myself — happy to show you what this looks like. Worth a quick conversation?

Best,
Kah
