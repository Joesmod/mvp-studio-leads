### Pain Points
- Project cost estimation relies heavily on senior estimators — bottleneck and knowledge risk
- Safety incident tracking and prevention is reactive, not predictive
- Subcontractor management and scheduling across multiple job sites

### Proposed AI Solution
AI **estimating co-pilot** that drafts cost estimates from blueprints and specs, learning from historical project data. Plus predictive safety analytics that flag high-risk conditions based on weather, crew fatigue patterns, and site activity.

### Why Now
Construction estimator shortage is real. AI augmentation lets fewer estimators handle more bids with better accuracy.
