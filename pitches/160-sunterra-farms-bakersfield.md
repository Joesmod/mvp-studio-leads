## AI Use Case: Irrigation Optimization & Crop Yield Forecasting

### Pain Points
- Water management is critical in drought-prone Central Valley — over-irrigation wastes scarce resources
- Crop yield forecasting relies on farmer experience rather than data
- Labor scheduling for harvest is guesswork, leading to over/under-staffing
- Pest and disease detection is visual and often too late

### Proposed Solution
AI-driven precision irrigation that integrates soil moisture sensors, weather forecasts, and crop growth models to optimize water usage field-by-field. ML yield forecasting from satellite imagery, weather data, and historical patterns. Drone-based crop health monitoring with AI pest/disease detection for early intervention.

### Expected Impact
- 25% reduction in water usage
- 15% improvement in yield accuracy for planning
- Early pest detection saving 10-20% of at-risk crop value
