## AI Use Case
**AI Tenant Screening & Maintenance Triage**

## Pain Points
- Tenant screening is slow and inconsistent, leading to high eviction rates (6-8%) and lost rent
- Maintenance requests flood in via phone, email, and text with no prioritization — urgent issues get buried
- Vacancy marketing is manual — listings go stale and rent pricing doesn't reflect real-time market data

## Proposed Solution
AI tenant scoring model incorporating credit, rental history, employment verification, and behavioral signals for more accurate screening. AI maintenance triage that categorizes and prioritizes requests, dispatches vendors automatically for emergencies, and predicts recurring issues. Dynamic rent pricing engine based on comparable listings, seasonality, and vacancy trends. Target: eviction rate under 3%, 40% faster maintenance response.
