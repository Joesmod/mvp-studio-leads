Hey -

I build custom software for e-commerce companies. Web apps, internal tools, AI automation.

Two relevant things:
• Built fulfillment and inventory tools that cut processing time by 40% for a multi-brand DTC company
• Worked on live event streaming systems at Noonchorus (now Mandolin) — real-time data at scale

With 1,400+ employees across multiple brands, you probably have internal tools on the backburner — reporting dashboards, brand-specific automation, integrations between systems.

Happy to share examples if relevant.

## Notes

- Employee-owned company (ESOP), vertically integrated
- Multiple health & wellness brands under one umbrella
- Likely pain points: cross-brand data, fulfillment coordination, ESOP administration tools
- Fast Company named them one of best places to work
