Hey Nimesh -

Saw Doodle Labs is powering comms for the Army's SRR program and partnering with FLIR, Freefly, and Teal. Impressive.

I build custom software for hardware companies scaling production. Web apps, internal tools, fleet management dashboards.

Two relevant things:
• Built real-time coordination systems at Noonchorus (now Mandolin) — thousands of concurrent connections, low latency
• Experience with production tracking and configuration management for hardware deployments

As you scale Mesh Rider production and fleet management across defense programs, internal tooling usually becomes a bottleneck.

Worth a 15-min chat?
