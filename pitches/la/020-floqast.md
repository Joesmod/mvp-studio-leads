## Email Draft

**Subject:** AI automation at FloQast

Hey Mike -

FloQast's AI push is impressive - auto-matching, variance explanations, the whole transformation play. That kind of rapid feature development usually means internal tooling and data pipeline work stacks up.

I build custom software for SaaS companies:
• Real-time systems at Noonchorus (live streaming, now Mandolin) - high-throughput coordination
• Data integration work at Opendate - syncing across fragmented systems

If you've got internal projects or automation work that needs dev bandwidth, I could help move them forward fast.

Worth a 15-min chat?
