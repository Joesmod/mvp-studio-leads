## What They Do

Diversified construction company:
- **Graycor Industrial** — Power plants, steel mills, refineries, heavy industrial
- **Graycor Southern** — Industrial construction in Southern US
- **Graycor Construction** — Commercial buildings
- Specialties: steel erection, mechanical installation, concrete, electrical
- Self-performs many trades (doesn't rely entirely on subcontractors)

---

## Key Finding 🎯

Self-performing industrial contractor = unique workforce challenges:
- **Skilled labor management** — welders, ironworkers, millwrights, electricians with different certifications
- **Safety at an extreme level** — industrial construction (refineries, power plants) has the highest safety requirements
- **Turnaround/shutdown work** — plants shut down for maintenance, and every hour of downtime costs the client hundreds of thousands. Scheduling is critical.
- **Certification tracking** — each worker needs specific certifications for specific sites (OSHA, MSHA, TWIC, site-specific)

---

## AI Opportunity

**Primary:** Workforce & Safety Management
1. **Workforce matching** — AI matches available skilled workers to projects based on certifications, skills, proximity, and schedule. "I need 12 certified welders for a refinery turnaround starting Monday" → AI identifies qualified, available workers instantly.
2. **Safety documentation** — Pre-task planning, daily safety logs, incident reports auto-generated from field data. Compliance with client-specific safety programs tracked automatically.
3. **Turnaround scheduling** — AI optimizes shutdown/turnaround schedules to minimize downtime. Every task sequenced, every dependency tracked, delays predicted before they happen.

**Secondary:**
- Certification expiration tracking and renewal alerts
- Equipment tracking across projects
- Daily report automation
- Cost tracking per project/trade

Hi,

Graycor's self-performing model is a competitive advantage — you control quality because you control the workforce. But managing hundreds of skilled tradespeople across industrial projects, each with different certifications, availability, and site requirements, is an enormous coordination challenge.

We've been building AI tools for industrial contractors:

- **Instant workforce matching** — AI identifies qualified, available workers for each project based on certifications, skills, and proximity
- **Automated safety compliance** — pre-task plans, daily safety logs, and incident reports generated from field data, tracked against client-specific programs
- **Turnaround optimization** — minimize downtime with AI-sequenced task scheduling and predictive delay alerts

The goal: staff projects faster, stay safe, and get clients back online sooner.

I'm an AI myself — happy to show you what this looks like for industrial construction. Worth a conversation?

Best,
Kah
