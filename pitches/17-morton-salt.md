## Company Profile

**Name:** Morton Salt, Inc.
**Founded:** 1848
**Location:** Chicago, IL (HQ)
**Website:** mortonsalt.com
**Industry:** Salt Mining / Chemical Manufacturing
**Employees:** Est. 2,000-3,000
**Parent:** K+S AG (German chemical company)
**Revenue:** Est. $1.5B+

---

## What They Do

One of the most iconic American brands:
- Table salt, cooking salt, specialty salts
- Road salt / de-icing products
- Industrial salt (chemical processing, water treatment)
- Food processing salt
- Operations: mines and plants across US and Canada

---

## Key Finding 🎯

Morton's business has extreme seasonality and complexity:
- **Winter = massive demand spike** for road salt (weather-dependent, unpredictable)
- Municipal contracts with delivery guarantees (miss a delivery during a snowstorm = breach)
- Multiple customer segments: consumer (grocery), industrial, municipal, food processing
- Mining operations with safety and environmental compliance
- Supply chain from mines → processing → distribution → retail/municipal

Weather-dependent demand + contractual delivery obligations = forecasting nightmare.

## AI Opportunity

**Primary:** Demand Forecasting & Supply Chain
1. **Weather-driven demand forecasting** — AI integrates weather models, historical snowfall data, and municipal contract requirements to forecast road salt demand weeks ahead. Pre-position inventory at regional depots before storms hit.
2. **Municipal contract management** — Track delivery obligations across hundreds of municipal contracts, auto-generate compliance reports, flag at-risk deliveries.
3. **Multi-segment order processing** — Consumer, industrial, and municipal orders have completely different workflows. AI routes and processes each appropriately.

**Secondary:**
- Mining operations safety documentation
- Environmental compliance reporting
- Supply chain optimization (mine → plant → depot → customer)
- Customer service across segments

**Subject:** 175 years of salt — what if you could predict demand before the storm?

Hi,

Morton Salt has been an American icon since 1848. And every winter, I imagine the same challenge: predicting exactly how much road salt to produce, where to position it, and how to fulfill hundreds of municipal contracts when a blizzard hits — all while managing consumer and industrial demand that runs year-round.

We've been building AI tools that help commodity producers with weather-sensitive demand:

- **Weather-integrated demand forecasting** — combine weather models, historical data, and contract obligations to predict needs by region weeks ahead
- **Municipal contract tracking** — automated compliance reporting, delivery scheduling, and at-risk alerts
- **Multi-segment order management** — consumer, industrial, and municipal orders each handled with the right workflow

The goal: when the next polar vortex hits, you're already positioned.

I'm an AI myself — happy to demo what predictive demand management looks like for weather-dependent products. Worth 15 minutes?

Best,

## Notes

**Strengths:**
- Iconic brand with massive budget
- Weather-dependent demand = clear AI use case
- Multiple business segments = complexity AI solves
- Chicago HQ

**Risks:**
- Very large company (owned by German K+S AG) = corporate procurement
- Likely has existing supply chain systems
- Need to find innovation contact, not get lost in corporate bureaucracy
- Position as enhancement to existing systems
