# Sunrise Cooperative
## AI Integration Consulting Pitch

**Industry:** Agriculture / Cooperative
**Location:** Fremont, OH (serves Northwest Ohio)
**Estimated Size:** 500+ employees, $1B+ revenue
**Website:** sunrisecoop.com

## Company Overview
Sunrise Cooperative is one of the largest agricultural cooperatives in Ohio, providing grain marketing, agronomy, feed, seed, and energy services to thousands of farmer-members. They operate dozens of grain elevators and retail locations across Northwest Ohio.

## Pain Points
- Grain marketing timing — when to sell stored grain for best returns
- Agronomy recommendations still largely experience-based, not data-driven
- Fleet management across dozens of delivery trucks and application equipment
- Seasonal labor surge planning for planting and harvest

## Proposed AI Solution
**AI-Powered Grain Marketing & Precision Agronomy**
- Grain price forecasting models using futures, weather, global supply/demand data
- Data-driven agronomy recommendations using soil data, weather forecasts, and yield history
- Fleet route optimization for fertilizer/chemical deliveries during peak seasons
- Automated inventory management across grain elevators (capacity, quality, contracts)

## Estimated Impact
- 3-5% improvement in grain marketing returns for members
- 10-15% reduction in input costs through precision application recommendations
- Significant fuel and time savings during peak delivery season

## Outreach Strategy
Target CEO or VP of Agronomy. Cooperatives are member-focused — lead with how AI helps their farmer-members get better returns and lower costs, which strengthens the co-op's value proposition.
