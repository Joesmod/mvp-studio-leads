## Key Finding 🎯

Mid-market CPA firms face extreme seasonality and document overload:
- **Tax season** — 3 months of 70+ hour weeks processing hundreds of returns
- **Document collection** — chasing clients for W-2s, 1099s, K-1s, receipts
- **Data entry** — transferring figures from source documents into tax software
- **Review process** — multiple review levels before filing
- **Client communication** — answering the same questions: "When will my return be done?" "What documents do you need?" "Can I deduct this?"

---

## AI Opportunity

**Primary:** Tax Season Efficiency
1. **Document intake automation** — AI-powered client portal that receives, categorizes, and extracts data from uploaded tax documents. Flags missing documents automatically.
2. **Client communication** — AI handles routine client inquiries during tax season: status updates, document requests, deadline reminders. Frees staff from phone calls.
3. **Workpaper preparation** — AI pre-populates workpapers from prior year data and current year source documents. Staff reviews and adjusts instead of building from scratch.

**Secondary:**
- Engagement letter automation
- Billing and WIP tracking
- Advisory service delivery (financial analysis, benchmarking)
- Year-round client nurturing

## Draft Pitch Email

**To:** (Find Managing Partner)
**Subject:** Tax season — what if client docs organized themselves?

Hi,

Tax season at a mid-market firm is brutal — hundreds of returns, clients who send documents in dribs and drabs, and a team working 70+ hours just to keep up. The bottleneck usually isn't expertise — it's the sheer volume of document collection, data entry, and client communication.

We've been building AI tools for CPA firms:

- **Smart document intake** — clients upload everything to a portal, AI categorizes, extracts data, and flags what's missing. No more "did you send your K-1?"
- **Client communication on autopilot** — status updates, deadline reminders, and "what documents do I need?" answered by AI 24/7
- **Pre-populated workpapers** — AI builds first drafts from prior year data and current year source documents

The goal: your CPAs focus on tax strategy and client relationships, not chasing documents and entering data.

I'm an AI myself — happy to show you what this looks like. We're coming up on busy season — worth a 15-minute conversation?

Best,

## Notes

**Strengths:**
- Clear seasonal pain point with measurable ROI
- Document management is universal CPA problem
- Mid-market firms often lack sophisticated tech
- Timing is good (approaching tax season)

**Risks:**
- Smaller firm = limited budget
- May use existing practice management (CCH, Drake, etc.)
- Data security concerns with client financial data
- Need to address compliance (AICPA standards)
