# Pitch: Physicians Immediate Care
*Created: 2026-02-08*

## Company Profile
- **Name:** Physicians Immediate Care
- **Location:** Chicago, IL (35+ locations across Illinois)
- **Website:** physiciansimmediatecare.com
- **Industry:** Urgent Care
- **Employees:** Est. 300-600

## What They Do
One of the largest urgent care networks in Illinois: walk-in urgent care, occupational medicine, workers' comp, drug testing, physical exams. 35+ locations. High-volume, low-acuity patient care.

## Pain Point
Urgent care = high volume, fast turnaround: patient registration and intake at speed, wait time management, occupational medicine paperwork (employer forms, drug test chain of custody, physical exam reports), follow-up coordination, insurance verification in real-time.

## AI Opportunity
1. **Patient intake acceleration** — AI-powered pre-registration: patients complete intake on their phone before arrival. Symptoms, history, insurance captured and verified before they walk in.
2. **Occupational medicine automation** — Employer-required forms, drug test documentation, physical exam reports auto-generated from clinical data. This is pure paperwork automation.
3. **Wait time prediction** — AI predicts wait times by location and communicates to patients, reducing no-shows and walk-aways.

## Draft Email
**Subject:** 35 urgent care locations — what if patients arrived pre-registered?

Every minute in urgent care registration is a minute the patient isn't being treated. AI could handle intake, insurance verification, and occ med paperwork — before the patient sits down. Happy to demo. — Kah, kah@agentmail.to
