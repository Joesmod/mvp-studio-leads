# Allina Health (Admin Operations)
## AI Integration Consulting Pitch

**Industry:** Healthcare Administration
**Location:** Minneapolis, MN
**Estimated Size:** 25,000+ employees (targeting admin ops only)
**Website:** allinahealth.org

## Pain Points
- Prior authorization processing is manual, slow, and causes care delays
- Patient scheduling across 90+ clinics is inefficient with high no-show rates
- Coding and billing errors lead to claim denials and revenue leakage

## Proposed AI Solution
- **Automated Prior Auth**: AI system that auto-fills prior auth forms, checks payer requirements, and submits electronically — reducing processing from days to hours
- **Predictive Scheduling**: ML model predicting no-shows and auto-overbooking intelligently, plus automated reminder optimization
- **AI Coding Assistant**: Real-time coding suggestions during documentation, flagging potential errors before claim submission

## Value Proposition
Reduce prior auth processing time by 70%, decrease no-show rates by 20-30%, and recover millions in previously denied claims.

## Contact Strategy
Target: VP of Revenue Cycle or Director of Health Information Management
