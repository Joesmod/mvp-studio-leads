# Carolina Property Management — Raleigh, NC

## Company Overview
- **Industry:** Real Estate / Property Management
- **Location:** Raleigh, NC
- **Estimated Size:** 50–100 employees
- **Manages:** 3,000+ residential units across Triangle area

## Pain Points
- Tenant maintenance requests come in via phone, email, and text — no unified system
- Lease renewal process is manual — renewals slip through cracks causing vacancies
- Vendor invoice reconciliation takes days of manual matching
- Move-in/move-out inspections are paper-based and inconsistent across properties

## Proposed AI Solution
- **AI maintenance triage:** Unified intake across all channels; AI categorizes urgency, dispatches appropriate vendor, and updates tenant automatically
- **Predictive lease management:** AI flags upcoming expirations, recommends renewal pricing based on market data, and auto-generates renewal offers
- **Invoice processing automation:** AI reads vendor invoices, matches to work orders, flags discrepancies, and queues for approval
- **Inspection automation:** Photo-based AI condition assessment during move-in/out, generating consistent reports and flagging damage for deposit claims

## Value Proposition
Cut maintenance response time by 50%, reduce vacancy loss by filling renewal gaps, and save 20 hours/week on invoice processing.

## Contact Research
- TBD — needs VP of Operations or owner contact
