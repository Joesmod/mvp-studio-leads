## AI Use Case: Supply Chain Coordination & Quality Prediction
DFA is the largest dairy cooperative in the US, coordinating milk collection from 13,000+ farms to processing plants. The logistics and quality management challenge is enormous.

## Pain Points
- Milk collection routing across thousands of farms is manually planned
- Quality variability in raw milk requiring lab testing at every receiving point
- Demand forecasting for dairy products with short shelf life
- Energy-intensive processing plants with limited optimization

## Proposed Solution
- AI-optimized milk collection routes reducing tanker miles and improving freshness
- Predictive quality models using farm-level data (feed, weather, season) to flag issues before delivery
- Short-shelf-life demand forecasting for fluid milk, cheese, and butter production planning
- Process energy optimization at cheese and butter manufacturing plants

## Estimated Impact
- 10-15% reduction in collection fleet costs
- Fewer quality rejections through predictive early warning
- Reduced overproduction waste on perishable products
