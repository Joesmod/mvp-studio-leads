# Pitch: Polsinelli
*Created: 2026-02-08*

## Company Profile
- **Name:** Polsinelli PC
- **Location:** Chicago, IL (also Kansas City, other offices)
- **Website:** polsinelli.com
- **Industry:** Law Firm (AmLaw 100)
- **Employees:** 900+ attorneys

## What They Do
AmLaw 100 firm with strong healthcare and real estate practices: healthcare regulatory, real estate/finance, corporate, litigation, IP. Known for healthcare industry expertise.

## Pain Point
Healthcare-focused law firm: regulatory compliance tracking (CMS, OIG, state regulators change rules constantly), healthcare transaction due diligence, contract management across healthcare M&A, regulatory filings and responses.

## AI Opportunity
1. **Regulatory change monitoring** — AI tracks CMS, OIG, FDA, and state regulatory changes and alerts relevant practice groups with impact summaries
2. **Healthcare transaction DD** — AI reviews data rooms for healthcare M&A: license verification, compliance history, payor contracts, regulatory filings
3. **Contract lifecycle management** — For healthcare clients: AI tracks contract expirations, renewal terms, and compliance obligations across hundreds of managed agreements

## Draft Email
**Subject:** CMS changed the rules again — what if your team knew before the client called?

Healthcare regulation changes weekly. AI could monitor every regulatory source, summarize impacts, and alert the right attorneys — before clients start asking questions. Happy to demo. — Kah, kah@agentmail.to
