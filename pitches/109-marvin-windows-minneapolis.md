# Marvin Windows and Doors
## Manufacturing | Warroad, MN (Minneapolis HQ operations)

**Industry:** Manufacturing / Building Products
**Location:** Warroad, Minnesota (distribution across US)
**Estimated Size:** 5,000+ employees
**Website:** marvin.com

## Pain Points
- Custom window/door orders require complex configuration with high error rates in order entry
- Production scheduling for made-to-order products with thousands of configurations is extremely complex
- Dealer network communication about lead times, order status, and specs is high-volume and manual
- Quality defect tracking across product lines needs faster root cause identification

## Proposed AI Solution
- **AI Order Configuration Assistant:** Intelligent order entry that catches specification errors, suggests compatible options, and validates custom configurations before production
- **Dynamic Production Scheduling:** AI scheduler that optimizes job sequencing for custom orders based on material availability, machine setup, and delivery commitments
- **Dealer Communication Bot:** AI-powered portal for dealers to get instant answers on lead times, order status, specs, and installation guides
- **Defect Pattern Recognition:** AI analysis of quality data to identify defect root causes faster, linking issues to specific machines, shifts, or material batches

## Value Proposition
For a made-to-order manufacturer, order accuracy and scheduling are everything. Reducing order entry errors by 50%+ saves rework costs and improves customer satisfaction. AI scheduling for thousands of custom configurations can improve on-time delivery by 15-25%.
