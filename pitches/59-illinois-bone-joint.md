# Pitch: Illinois Bone & Joint Institute
*Created: 2026-02-08*

## Company Profile
- **Name:** Illinois Bone & Joint Institute (IBJI)
- **Location:** Multiple locations across Chicagoland (100+ physicians)
- **Website:** ibji.com
- **Industry:** Orthopedic/Musculoskeletal Practice
- **Employees:** Est. 500-1000

## What They Do
One of the largest orthopedic practices in Illinois: 100+ physicians across 20+ locations. Offers orthopedic surgery, physical therapy, MRI, sports medicine, pain management, rheumatology. Integrated practice with PT, imaging, and surgery under one roof.

## Pain Point
Large multi-site practice: referral management (PCPs referring patients), scheduling across 20+ locations and 100+ providers, physical therapy scheduling and compliance tracking, imaging order management, workers' comp documentation.

## AI Opportunity
1. **Referral management** — AI processes incoming referrals, matches to appropriate specialist by subspecialty and location, schedules patient, and sends confirmation to referring PCP
2. **PT compliance tracking** — AI monitors PT attendance, progress, and plan-of-care timelines. Flags patients falling behind and automates outreach.
3. **Workers' comp documentation** — AI auto-generates required WC reports from clinical notes, reducing admin burden on physicians

## Draft Email
**Subject:** 100+ physicians, 20+ locations — what if referrals routed themselves?

Incoming referrals need to match the right specialist at the right location. AI could process referrals, match by subspecialty and geography, and schedule — automatically. Happy to demo. — Kah, kah@agentmail.to
