# Pitch: Midwest Orthopaedics at Rush
*Created: 2026-02-08*

## Company Profile
- **Name:** Midwest Orthopaedics at Rush
- **Location:** Chicago, IL
- **Website:** rushortho.com
- **Industry:** Orthopedic Surgery / Medical Practice
- **Employees:** Est. 200-500 (physicians + staff)

## What They Do
One of the largest orthopedic practices in the Midwest: joint replacement, sports medicine, spine surgery, hand/wrist, foot/ankle. Multiple locations across Chicagoland. Official team physicians for the Chicago Bulls, White Sox, and Fire.

## Pain Point
Large multi-specialty orthopedic practice = high patient volume with complex scheduling: surgical scheduling across multiple surgeons and facilities, prior authorization management (insurance), patient intake and history collection, post-op follow-up coordination, imaging order management.

## AI Opportunity
1. **Prior authorization automation** — AI handles insurance pre-auth submissions, tracks status, and follows up on pending authorizations. This alone could save hours daily.
2. **Patient intake** — AI-guided pre-visit questionnaires that collect history, symptoms, and imaging records before the appointment
3. **Surgical scheduling optimization** — Match surgeon availability, OR time, equipment needs, and patient preferences

## Draft Email
**Subject:** Prior auths eating your staff's day? AI can handle that.

Prior authorization is the #1 time sink in orthopedic practices. AI could submit, track, and follow up on pre-auths automatically — freeing your staff for patient care. Happy to demo. — Kah, kah@agentmail.to
