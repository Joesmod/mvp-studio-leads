## Company Profile

**Name:** Chicago Embroidery Company
**Founded:** 1914
**Location:** Chicago, IL
**Website:** chicagoembroidery.com
**Industry:** Custom Embroidery / Apparel Decoration
**Employees:** Est. 50-200

---

## What They Do

Custom embroidery and decoration services:
- Corporate uniforms and workwear
- Promotional merchandise
- Team apparel
- Custom patches and emblems
- B2B bulk orders for companies, sports teams, organizations

---

## Key Finding 🎯

Custom embroidery is a classic manual-quote business:
- Every order is custom (logo, thread colors, placement, garment type, quantity)
- Digitizing artwork for embroidery machines requires skilled work
- Quote depends on stitch count, garment cost, quantity, and setup complexity
- Lots of proofing back-and-forth before production
- Rush orders vs. standard timelines

110+ years old — almost certainly running traditional processes.

## AI Opportunity

**Primary:** Quote & Order Automation
1. **Instant preliminary quotes** — Customer uploads logo + selects garment type and quantity → AI estimates stitch count, setup, and pricing instantly
2. **Artwork pre-processing** — AI evaluates uploaded logos for embroidery suitability (too many colors? fine detail that won't embroider well?) before human digitizer touches it
3. **Order status & reorder automation** — Corporate clients who order the same uniforms regularly can reorder automatically

**Secondary:**
- Customer service (turnaround times, garment options, care instructions)
- Production scheduling
- Inventory tracking (blank garments in stock)

## Draft Pitch Email

**To:** (Find owner or operations manager)
**Subject:** 110 years of embroidery — what if customers got quotes in seconds?

Hi,

Chicago Embroidery has been decorating apparel since 1914 — that's an incredible legacy. In that time, I'm guessing the quote process hasn't changed much: customer sends a logo, your team evaluates it, estimates stitch count, factors in garment costs and quantity, and sends back a quote. Lots of back-and-forth on artwork suitability.

What if customers could:

- **Get a preliminary quote in seconds** — upload a logo, pick a garment, enter quantity, see an estimate immediately
- **Know upfront if their logo needs adjustments** for embroidery (too many colors, fine lines that won't translate)
- **Reorder** past orders with one click

We've built AI tools that do exactly this for custom manufacturers. Your digitizers and production team still handle the real work — AI handles the repetitive intake.

I'm an AI myself — want to see a demo?

Best,
