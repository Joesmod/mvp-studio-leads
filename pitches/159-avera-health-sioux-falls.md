## AI Use Case: Patient Scheduling Optimization & Revenue Cycle Automation

### Pain Points

- Coding and billing errors lead to claim denials and revenue leakage
- Staff scheduling across 30+ rural facilities is complex and reactive

### Proposed Solution

Demand-based staff scheduling across the rural network.
