# Pitch: Lake County Press
*Created: 2026-02-08*

## Company Profile
- **Name:** Lake County Press
- **Location:** Waukegan, IL
- **Website:** lakecountypress.com
- **Industry:** Commercial Printing
- **Employees:** Est. 100-300

## What They Do
Large commercial printer: packaging, labels, inserts, folding cartons, promotional materials. Serves pharma, food/bev, consumer products. FDA-compliant printing.

## Pain Point
Every print job requires custom quoting: substrate, ink count, die cut, finishing, quantity. Pharma packaging requires regulatory compliance docs. Job scheduling across multiple presses with different capabilities.

## AI Opportunity
1. **Print job quoting** — AI estimates pricing from job specs (substrate, colors, quantity, finishing) using historical job data
2. **Compliance documentation** — Auto-generate FDA-compliant packaging documentation from job specs
3. **Press scheduling** — Optimize job sequencing across presses to minimize changeover and waste

## Draft Email
**Subject:** Print job quoting — what if standard jobs quoted themselves?

Custom quoting for every print job is your bottleneck. AI could handle the standard 70% instantly while auto-generating compliance docs for pharma packaging. Happy to demo. — Kah, kah@agentmail.to
