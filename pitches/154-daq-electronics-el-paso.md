## AI Use Case: PCB Defect Detection & Supply Chain Forecasting

### Pain Points
- Visual inspection of printed circuit boards is labor-intensive and error-prone
- Cross-border supply chain (US-Mexico) creates unpredictable lead times
- Production planning relies on spreadsheets and tribal knowledge
- High scrap rate on complex assemblies

### Proposed Solution
Computer vision system for automated PCB inspection that catches micro-defects human inspectors miss. ML-based supply chain forecasting that accounts for border crossing delays and vendor reliability. AI production planner that optimizes line scheduling based on order priority and component availability.

### Expected Impact
- 35% reduction in defect escape rate
- 20% improvement in on-time delivery
- 15% reduction in scrap/rework costs
