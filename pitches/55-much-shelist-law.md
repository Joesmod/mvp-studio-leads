# Pitch: Much Shelist
*Created: 2026-02-08*

## Company Profile
- **Name:** Much Shelist, P.C.
- **Location:** Chicago, IL
- **Website:** muchlaw.com
- **Industry:** Law Firm (Mid-Market)
- **Employees:** Est. 100-200 (attorneys + staff)

## What They Do
Mid-size Chicago law firm: corporate/M&A, real estate, litigation, employment, tax, estate planning. Serves mid-market businesses and high-net-worth individuals.

## Pain Point
Mid-size law firms compete with BigLaw on quality but with leaner teams. Time-intensive work: contract review and drafting, due diligence in M&A transactions, document review in litigation, client intake and conflict checks, billing and time entry.

## AI Opportunity
1. **Contract review & drafting** — AI reviews contracts against firm standards, flags unusual terms, and generates first drafts from templates with deal-specific parameters
2. **Due diligence automation** — In M&A: AI reviews data room documents, extracts key terms, flags risks, and generates summaries
3. **Client intake & conflict checking** — AI processes new matter requests, runs conflict checks across the firm's database, and routes for clearance

## Draft Email
**Subject:** M&A due diligence — what if the data room reviewed itself?

Every deal means hundreds of documents in a data room. AI could extract key terms, flag risks, and generate summaries — letting your attorneys focus on analysis, not reading. Happy to demo. — Kah, kah@agentmail.to
