## Company Profile

**Name:** Lake Shore Cryotronics
**Founded:** 1968
**Location:** Westerville, OH (serves Midwest market)
**Website:** lakeshore.com
**Industry:** Scientific Instruments / Precision Measurement
**Employees:** Est. 200-400

---

## What They Do

Manufactures precision measurement instruments:
- Cryogenic temperature sensors and controllers
- Magnetic measurement systems (gaussmeters, Hall probes)
- Material characterization systems
- Calibration services
- Serves: universities, national labs, semiconductor companies, aerospace

---

## Key Finding 🎯

Scientific instruments require extensive pre-sales technical support:
- Customers are scientists/engineers with specific measurement needs
- Product selection requires matching specs to application requirements
- Calibration services need scheduling and certificate management
- Technical documentation is extensive (spec sheets, application notes, calibration procedures)
- Post-sale support for installation, troubleshooting, and recalibration

---

## AI Opportunity

**Primary:** Technical Sales & Calibration Management
1. **Technical product selection** — "I need to measure temperatures from 4K to 300K in a 5 Tesla magnetic field" → AI recommends the right sensor type, controller, and accessories based on application requirements.
2. **Calibration scheduling & certificates** — AI manages the calibration lifecycle: schedules due dates, sends reminders, processes incoming instruments, and generates calibration certificates from test data.
3. **Application support** — AI answers technical questions from researchers: measurement techniques, sensor selection, troubleshooting, installation guidance.

**Secondary:**
- Quote generation for instrument packages
- Order processing
- Documentation delivery (manuals, spec sheets, app notes)
- Training material delivery

**To:** (Find VP Sales or VP Operations)
**Subject:** When a physicist needs a cryogenic sensor — what if AI could match them in seconds?

Hi,

Lake Shore builds instruments that push the boundaries of measurement — cryogenic sensors, magnetic measurement, material characterization. Your customers are scientists and engineers who need precise solutions for specific applications.

That means your sales team spends significant time on technical consultations: "What sensor works in my magnetic field?" "Which controller handles my temperature range?" "When is my probe due for recalibration?"

We've been building AI tools for technical instrument companies:

- **Application-based product selection** — customer describes their measurement needs, AI recommends the right instruments with full compatibility checking
- **Calibration lifecycle management** — automated scheduling, reminders, processing, and certificate generation
- **First-level technical support** — measurement technique guidance, troubleshooting, and installation help

The goal: your scientists focus on pushing measurement boundaries, not answering routine selection questions.

I'm an AI myself — happy to demonstrate. Worth a conversation?

Best,
Kah

## Notes

**Strengths:**
- Technical product = high pre-sales support burden
- Calibration management is recurring revenue with clear automation potential
- Scientific instrument market is underserved by AI tools
- Right size range (200-400 employees)

**Risks:**
- Not Chicago-based (Ohio) — Midwest reach though
- Niche market = smaller total addressable opportunity
- Scientists may be skeptical of AI accuracy for technical recommendations
