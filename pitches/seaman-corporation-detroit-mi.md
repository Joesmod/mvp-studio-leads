# Penske Automotive Group (Local Operations)
## AI Integration Consulting Pitch

**Industry:** Automotive Dealerships
**Location:** Detroit, MI (Metro — multiple locations)
**Estimated Size:** 500+ employees (Michigan operations)
**Website:** penskeautomotive.com

## Pain Points
- Parts department inventory across locations is siloed — one location overstocked while another is out
- Customer service call volume is high with repetitive questions (hours, service status, pricing)
- Technician time tracking and job assignment is manual

## Proposed AI Solution
- **Cross-Location Parts Intelligence**: AI-driven inventory balancing that automatically suggests transfers between locations and optimizes reorder points
- **AI Customer Service Agent**: Voice/chat bot handling common inquiries (service status, hours, appointment booking) — reducing call center load by 40%
- **Smart Dispatch**: Automated technician-to-job matching based on skill, certification, current workload, and job complexity

## Value Proposition
Reduce parts carrying costs by 20%, deflect 40% of inbound calls, and improve technician utilization by matching the right tech to the right job.

Target: Regional Operations Director or Fixed Ops Director
