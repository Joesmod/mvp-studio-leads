# Pitch: Dental Associates / Mid-Size Dental Groups (Chicago)
*Created: 2026-02-08*

## Company Profile
- **Name:** Dental Associates of Chicago (representative of mid-size dental groups)
- **Location:** Chicago, IL
- **Industry:** Dental Practice Group
- **Employees:** Est. 50-200 per group

## What They Do
Multi-location dental practice groups: general dentistry, cosmetic, orthodontics, oral surgery. Multiple offices, dozens of providers, thousands of patients.

## Pain Point
Dental groups struggle with: patient scheduling optimization (empty chairs = lost revenue), insurance verification (manual calls to verify benefits before every visit), treatment plan follow-up (patients accept treatment but never schedule), recall/reactivation (patients who haven't been back in 6+ months).

## AI Opportunity
1. **Insurance verification** — AI verifies patient benefits automatically before appointments, flags issues, and presents coverage info to front desk
2. **Treatment plan follow-up** — AI contacts patients who accepted treatment plans but haven't scheduled, with personalized outreach
3. **Chair utilization** — AI optimizes scheduling to minimize empty chairs: waitlist management, same-day fill, recall campaigns

## Draft Email
**Subject:** Empty chairs and unscheduled treatment plans — AI fixes both.

The average dental practice loses $100K+/year in unscheduled treatment and empty chairs. AI could verify insurance, follow up on accepted treatments, and fill cancellations automatically. Happy to demo. — Kah, kah@agentmail.to
