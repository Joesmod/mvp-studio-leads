# Pitch: Duane Morris LLP (Chicago Office)
*Created: 2026-02-08*

## Company Profile
- **Name:** Duane Morris LLP
- **Location:** Chicago, IL (national firm)
- **Website:** duanemorris.com
- **Industry:** Law Firm (AmLaw 100)
- **Employees:** 800+ attorneys

## What They Do
AmLaw 100 firm with diverse practice: corporate, trial, real estate, employment, IP, energy, cannabis law. Chicago office is a major hub.

## Pain Point
Large firms generate massive volumes of documents: briefs, contracts, discovery responses, regulatory filings. Junior associates spend 60%+ of their time on document review and drafting. Knowledge management across offices is weak. Client reporting/billing is complex.

## AI Opportunity
1. **Document drafting** — AI generates first drafts of briefs, contracts, and correspondence from templates and matter-specific parameters. Associates refine instead of starting blank.
2. **Discovery review** — AI-assisted document review for litigation: relevance classification, privilege detection, key document identification
3. **Client reporting** — AI generates matter status reports, budget tracking, and work summaries from time entries and docket data

## Draft Email
**Subject:** Associates drafting from scratch — what if AI wrote the first draft?

Junior associates spend hours on first drafts that follow patterns. AI could generate draft briefs, contracts, and correspondence from your templates — letting associates focus on analysis and strategy. Happy to demo. — Kah, kah@agentmail.to
