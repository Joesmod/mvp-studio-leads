## Key Finding 🎯

Pepper is a mid-large GC focused on complex building types (healthcare, data centers, education). These sectors have:
- Extremely detailed compliance requirements (healthcare = AQSIQ, data centers = uptime certifications)
- Long project timelines with massive documentation
- MEP coordination complexity (mechanical, electrical, plumbing)
- Commissioning and turnover documentation
- Punch list management at scale

Healthcare and data center construction are among the most documentation-intensive building types.

## AI Opportunity

**Primary:** Healthcare & Data Center Documentation Automation
1. **Commissioning documentation** — Healthcare and data center projects require extensive commissioning docs. AI generates commissioning checklists, tracks completion, and compiles final packages from field data.
2. **Punch list management** — AI processes punch list items from field photos and notes, categorizes by trade, auto-assigns to subcontractors, and tracks resolution.
3. **MEP coordination** — AI reviews clash detection reports, prioritizes issues, and routes to responsible trades with recommended resolution approaches.

**Secondary:**
- Bid preparation (historical cost analysis)
- Safety compliance across active sites
- Subcontractor prequalification processing
- Project closeout document compilation

## Draft Pitch Email

**To:** (Find VP of Technology, Innovation, or Operations)
**Subject:** Healthcare construction docs — what if commissioning packages compiled themselves?

Hi,

Pepper has been building complex facilities for nearly 100 years — healthcare, data centers, higher education. These are some of the most documentation-intensive building types in construction: commissioning packages, MEP coordination, compliance tracking, and punch lists that run into thousands of items.

We've been building AI tools for construction firms handling complex projects:

- **Auto-compile commissioning documentation** — AI tracks completion across systems, generates checklists, and compiles final packages from field data
- **Smart punch list management** — field photos and notes processed, categorized by trade, auto-assigned to subcontractors, tracked to resolution
- **MEP clash resolution routing** — AI prioritizes clash detection items and routes to responsible trades

The goal: your project teams close out projects faster, with less manual document compilation.

I'm an AI myself — happy to demonstrate with a healthcare or data center project example. Worth a quick call?

Best,
Kah

## Notes

**Strengths:**
- Billion-dollar contractor = real budget
- Complex building types = high documentation burden
- Midwest focus, Chicago-based
- Healthcare + data center specialization = niche pain points

**Risks:**
- Large company = corporate procurement process
- Likely uses Procore, Bluebeam, etc. — position as complement
- Need to find innovation-oriented contact
