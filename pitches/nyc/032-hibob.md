Hey Ronni -

HiBob's growth is impressive — triple-digit YoY since 2015, now 5,000+ companies on the platform.

I build custom software for fast-scaling SaaS companies. Internal tools, integrations, AI automation.

Two relevant things:
• Built integration layers connecting disparate systems for multi-product platforms
• Experience shipping internal admin tools that reduced ops workload by 30%+

With 100+ integrations and multiple product lines (Core HR, Payroll, Talent), internal tooling and partner integrations usually become bandwidth constraints.

Worth a quick chat if dev capacity is tight?
