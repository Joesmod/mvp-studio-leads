## Email Draft

**Subject:** Integration dev for Coconut

Hey Katherine -

Coconut's handling complex scheduling across branches, channels, and banker expertise. That usually means integration work becomes a bottleneck as you scale.

I build custom software for B2B platforms:
• Real-time coordination at Noonchorus (live streaming, now Mandolin) - matching resources to demand
• Integration work with venue systems at Opendate - syncing data across fragmented tech stacks

If you've got integration projects or internal tools stuck on the backburner, I could help move them forward.

Quick call to see if I can help?
