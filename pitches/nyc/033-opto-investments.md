Hey team -

Saw Opto is building end-to-end infrastructure for private markets — fund launch in 2-3 weeks is fast.

I build custom software for fintech companies. Internal tools, integrations, automation.

Two relevant things:
• Built real-time data pipelines and reporting dashboards for financial services clients
• Experience integrating with custodians and investment platforms

As you scale fund operations and partner onboarding, internal workflow automation usually becomes a bottleneck — compliance tracking, LP reporting, document generation.

Worth a quick call to see if I can help?
