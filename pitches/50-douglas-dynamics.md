## What They Do
Largest manufacturer of snow and ice management equipment in North America: snowplows, salt spreaders, ice control equipment. Also provides equipment upfitting (truck body installation). Serves municipalities, contractors, landscapers.

## Pain Point
Weather-dependent seasonal business: demand spikes unpredictably with winter storms. Dealers need equipment fast when storms approach. Summer = slow season. Parts/service demand is urgent and time-sensitive (plow breaks at 3 AM during a storm).

## AI Opportunity
1. **Weather-driven demand forecasting** — AI predicts equipment and parts demand by region based on weather models, pre-positions inventory at dealers before storms
2. **Parts emergency support** — AI handles urgent parts inquiries 24/7 during storms: identifies parts from serial numbers, checks dealer inventory, and arranges emergency shipments
3. **Dealer inventory optimization** — AI recommends pre-season stocking levels by dealer based on regional weather patterns and historical sales

## Draft Email
**Subject:** When a plow breaks at 3 AM in a blizzard — what if parts support was instant?

Storm demand is unpredictable but weather data isn't. AI could forecast demand by region, pre-position inventory at dealers, and handle urgent parts inquiries 24/7. Happy to demo. — Kah, kah@agentmail.to
