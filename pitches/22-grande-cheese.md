# Pitch: Grande Cheese Company
*Created: 2026-02-08*

---

## Company Profile

**Name:** Grande Cheese Company
**Founded:** 1941
**Location:** Fond du Lac, WI (with Chicago-area distribution)
**Website:** grandecheese.com
**Industry:** Cheese Manufacturing (Italian-style)
**Employees:** Est. 300-600
**Ownership:** Private

---

## What They Do

Premium Italian cheese manufacturer — the "pizza cheese" leader:
- Mozzarella (their flagship — used by top pizzerias)
- Ricotta, Parmesan, provolone
- Supplies pizzerias, Italian restaurants, food manufacturers
- Known as the premium choice — "the best mozzarella in America" reputation
- B2B only — foodservice and food manufacturing

---

## Key Finding 🎯

Grande serves thousands of pizzerias and Italian restaurants:
- High-volume recurring B2B orders (restaurants order weekly)
- Product quality is their differentiator — requires rigorous QC
- Cold chain logistics for perishable dairy
- Seasonal demand variations (pizza sales spike in certain seasons/events)
- Customer loyalty program and relationship management

---

## AI Opportunity

**Primary:** B2B Order & Quality Management
1. **Recurring order automation** — Pizzerias order the same products weekly. AI manages standing orders, auto-adjusts for seasonal patterns, and processes changes without manual intervention.
2. **Quality documentation** — Premium positioning requires rigorous QC. AI automates batch testing documentation, traceability records, and generates compliance reports.
3. **Customer retention analytics** — AI monitors ordering patterns and flags at-risk accounts (decreasing order frequency = potential churn).

**Secondary:**
- Demand forecasting for production planning
- Cold chain monitoring and logistics
- New account onboarding automation

## Draft Pitch Email

**To:** (Find VP Sales or Operations)
**Subject:** America's best mozzarella — what if reorders ran themselves?

Hi,

Grande has earned its reputation as the premium Italian cheese — pizzerias choose you because quality matters. But serving thousands of restaurant accounts means processing thousands of recurring orders, managing quality documentation at scale, and keeping every customer feeling like they matter.

We've been building AI tools for premium food suppliers:

- **Automate recurring orders** — your regular accounts processed automatically, with AI adjusting for seasonal demand and flagging changes for review
- **Streamline QC documentation** — batch testing, traceability, and compliance reports generated from production data
- **Monitor account health** — AI flags accounts with declining order frequency before they churn

The goal: your team focuses on winning new accounts and maintaining quality, not processing the same orders every week.

I'm an AI myself — happy to show you what this looks like. Worth a conversation?

Best,
Kah
