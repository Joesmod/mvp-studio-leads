**Industry:** Candy / Confections Manufacturing
**Employees:** Est. 4,000-6,000

---

## What They Do

One of the largest candy companies in the US:

---

## Key Finding 🎯

Seasonal candy production is an extreme demand forecasting challenge:
- **Halloween alone** accounts for a massive % of annual revenue
- Production must ramp months before the season
- Each retailer has different promotional calendars and order volumes
- Dozens of brands, hundreds of SKUs
- Seasonal packaging/assortments that change annually
- Returns/unsold seasonal inventory management

---

## AI Opportunity

**Primary:** Demand Forecasting & Retail Account Management
1. **Seasonal demand forecasting** — AI predicts demand by SKU, retailer, and region months ahead. Factors in promotional calendars, historical sell-through, weather, and consumer trends.
2. **Retail account order management** — Each major retailer (Walmart, Target, CVS, grocery chains) orders differently. AI manages the complexity of retailer-specific packaging, pricing, and promotional requirements.
3. **Production planning** — AI optimizes production scheduling across dozens of brands and hundreds of SKUs, balancing seasonal ramps with year-round production.

**Secondary:**
- New product demand estimation
- Promotional ROI analysis
- Supply chain risk monitoring (ingredient sourcing)
- Returns/markdown prediction for seasonal items

## Draft Pitch Email

**To:** (Find VP Supply Chain, VP Operations, or CTO)
**Subject:** Halloween is 8 months away — does your production plan know that?

Hi,

Ferrara produces some of America's most iconic candy — Trolli, Nerds, SweeTARTS, and dozens more. With seasonal demand spikes that can make or break a year (Halloween alone must be enormous), production planning starts months in advance across hundreds of SKUs and dozens of retailers.

We've been building AI tools for CPG manufacturers with seasonal demand:

- **Multi-variable demand forecasting** — predict by SKU, retailer, and region, incorporating promotional calendars, historical sell-through, and consumer trends
- **Retailer-specific order management** — each chain's unique packaging, pricing, and promotional requirements handled systematically
- **Production optimization** — schedule seasonal ramps across brands without disrupting year-round production

At your scale, even a 2% improvement in forecast accuracy saves millions in overproduction or missed sales.

I'm an AI myself — happy to walk through what predictive demand looks like for seasonal confections. Worth a conversation?

Best,
Kah

## Notes

**Strengths:**
- $3B+ revenue = massive budget
- Seasonal forecasting is high-value AI use case
- Dozens of brands = production complexity
- Chicago HQ

**Risks:**
- Owned by Ferrero (Italian) = corporate procurement
- 4,000+ employees = likely has existing demand planning tools
- Need to position as enhancement, not replacement
- Very large company = long sales cycle
