# Pitch: Eli's Cheesecake Company
*Created: 2026-02-08*

---

## Company Profile

**Name:** Eli's Cheesecake Company
**Founded:** 1980
**Location:** Chicago, IL
**Website:** elicheesecake.com
**Industry:** Food Production / Bakery Manufacturing
**Employees:** 51-200
**Owner:** Marc Schulman (President, son of founder)

---

## What They Do

Chicago's most famous cheesecake company:
- Large-scale cheesecake and dessert manufacturing
- B2B wholesale (restaurants, hotels, grocery, airlines)
- Direct-to-consumer (retail store, online orders, tours)
- Catering and custom orders
- Seasonal production spikes (holidays = massive volume)

**Known for:** "Chicago's most famous dessert" — Original Plain Cheesecake
**Expanded to:** Chocolate, fruit, caramel varieties, tarts, cakes, tiramisu

---

## Key Finding 🎯

They serve both B2B wholesale AND direct consumer — two very different order flows:
- Wholesale: recurring orders from restaurants/hotels/grocery chains
- DTC: individual online orders, gift shipments (perishable = complex logistics)
- Tours and events at their bakery
- Seasonal demand spikes (Thanksgiving, Christmas, Valentine's Day)

This mix creates scheduling, order management, and customer service complexity at a company that's probably still running lean.

## AI Opportunity

**Primary:** Order Management & Demand Forecasting
1. **B2B reorder automation** — Regular wholesale customers probably order the same things. AI processes routine reorders automatically, flags changes for review.
2. **Seasonal demand forecasting** — Cheesecake demand is highly seasonal. AI forecasting optimizes production scheduling so they're not caught short at Thanksgiving or overproducing in January.
3. **Customer service for DTC** — Order tracking, gift inquiries, product questions, dietary info (gluten-free options, ingredients) handled by AI 24/7.

**Secondary:**
- Production scheduling optimization
- Quality control documentation (food safety, batch tracking)
- Tour/event booking automation

## Draft Pitch Email

**To:** (Find operations contact — Marc Schulman is accessible, often does press)
**Subject:** Holiday order rush — what if Eli's never missed a forecast again?

Hi Marc,

Eli's is a Chicago institution — and I imagine the holiday seasons are both your biggest opportunity and biggest headache. Forecasting how many cheesecakes to produce for Thanksgiving, managing wholesale reorders from restaurants, handling the flood of online gift orders — all while keeping quality at the level your father set.

We've been building AI tools that help food producers like Eli's:

- **Forecast seasonal demand** — so production is dialed in weeks ahead, not scrambling
- **Automate wholesale reorders** — your regular restaurant and grocery accounts processed without manual entry
- **Handle customer service 24/7** — order tracking, dietary questions, gift inquiries answered instantly

The goal: your team focuses on making incredible cheesecake, not chasing orders and answering "is my gift shipment on time?" calls.

I'm an AI myself — happy to show you what this could look like specifically for Eli's. Worth a quick conversation?

Best,
