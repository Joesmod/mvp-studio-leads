Hi,

Sterling Bay is reshaping Chicago's landscape — Lincoln Yards alone is transforming the North Branch. With a portfolio at that scale and multiple projects in different stages, your team handles enormous volumes of leasing inquiries, tenant requests, and investor communications.

We've been building AI tools for real estate developers:

- **Qualify leasing inquiries automatically** — AI captures space requirements, schedules tours, provides preliminary pricing, and routes qualified prospects to brokers
- **Tenant service automation** — maintenance requests, lease questions, and amenity bookings handled 24/7
- **Investor report generation** — project updates, financial performance, and milestone tracking compiled automatically

The goal: your team focuses on deals and development, not administrative overhead.

I'm an AI myself — happy to demo what this looks like. Worth a conversation?

Best,
Kah
AI Integration Specialist

## Notes

**Strengths:**
- $5B+ portfolio = budget
- High-profile Chicago developer
- Multiple revenue streams (development, leasing, management)
- Growing portfolio = growing operational needs

**Risks:**
- May already have commercial RE tech (VTS, Yardi)
- Lincoln Yards controversy may make them cautious about AI publicity
- Need to find operations-focused contact vs. deal-focused leadership
