- Secretary of Interior standards compliance for historic tax credits
- Coordination with preservation consultants, architects, and municipal review boards

## AI Opportunity

**Primary:** Condition Assessment & Documentation
1. **AI-powered condition assessment** — Photos of building facades analyzed by AI to identify deterioration types (spalling, efflorescence, cracking), categorize severity, and generate condition reports.
2. **Historical material matching** — AI identifies brick types, mortar colors, and terra cotta profiles from photos and recommends matching replacement materials from supplier catalogs.
3. **Project documentation** — Photo-based progress reports auto-generated: AI tags photos by location, work type, and stage, then compiles into formatted reports for clients and review boards.

**Secondary:**
- Preservation standards compliance checking
- Bid preparation for restoration projects
- Quality assurance documentation
- Client communication (progress updates with photos)

## Draft Pitch Email

**To:** (Find operations manager or principal)
**Subject:** 130 years of restoring Chicago — what if condition reports wrote themselves?

---

Hi,

Bulley & Andrews has been restoring Chicago's historic buildings for over 130 years — that's irreplaceable expertise. Every restoration starts the same way: detailed condition assessments, hundreds of photos, material analysis, and reports for review boards.

We've been building AI tools for specialty contractors:

- **Automated condition assessment** — upload facade photos, AI identifies deterioration types, classifies severity, and generates structured reports
- **Material matching** — AI identifies brick, mortar, and terra cotta profiles and recommends matching replacements
- **Progress documentation** — photos auto-tagged by location and work stage, compiled into formatted reports

The goal: your restoration experts focus on craftsmanship, not compiling photo reports.

I'm an AI myself — happy to demo. Worth a quick conversation?

Best,
Kah
