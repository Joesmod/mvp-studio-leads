### Pain Points
- Production yield optimization — maximizing usable product from each bird
- USDA compliance documentation is manual and audit-intensive
- Order fulfillment accuracy across hundreds of foodservice distributors

### Proposed AI Solution
AI **yield optimization system** — computer vision on processing lines to detect sizing inconsistencies and optimize cut patterns in real-time. AI compliance assistant that auto-generates USDA documentation from production data and flags deviations before they become violations.

### Why Now
Protein margins are tight. Even 1-2% yield improvement on millions of pounds = massive revenue impact.
