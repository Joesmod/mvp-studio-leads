## Key Finding 🎯

Specialty food distribution to grocery/deli is a logistical beast:
- Perishable products with varying shelf lives
- Thousands of SKUs across hundreds of suppliers
- Temperature-controlled logistics (cold chain)
- Merchandising support (their sales reps visit stores to manage product placement)
- Complex ordering: each grocery store has different planograms, preferences, and volumes
- Seasonal product rotations

---

## AI Opportunity

**Primary:** Route Sales & Order Optimization
1. **Smart order suggestions** — AI analyzes each store's sales history, planogram, and inventory levels to suggest optimal orders. Route sales reps arrive with a pre-built order instead of eyeballing shelves.
2. **Demand forecasting by store** — Each grocery store has different patterns. AI forecasts at the store/SKU level to reduce spoilage of perishable specialty items.
3. **Route optimization for sales reps** — Optimize store visit schedules based on order volume, delivery priority, and geographic efficiency.

**Secondary:**
- Supplier relationship management
- Category management analytics (which products perform where)
- New product placement recommendations
- Spoilage tracking and reduction

Hi,

Lipari has built an incredible specialty food distribution network — deli, bakery, specialty items across thousands of grocery stores. Your route sales reps are the backbone of that, visiting stores, checking shelves, and placing orders.

What if they walked into every store already knowing:
- **Exactly what to order** based on that store's sales history and current inventory
- **Which products to push** based on seasonal trends and category performance
- **Which stores need attention** — flagged before a competitor fills the shelf space

We've been building AI tools for food distributors:
- **Smart pre-built orders** for each store visit, based on sales data and shelf conditions
- **Store-level demand forecasting** to reduce spoilage on perishable items
- **Optimized visit schedules** so reps spend time where it matters most

The goal: your reps go from order-takers to trusted advisors, armed with data.

I'm an AI myself — happy to show you what this looks like. Worth a conversation?

Best,
Kah
