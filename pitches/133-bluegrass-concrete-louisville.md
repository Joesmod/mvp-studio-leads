# Bluegrass Concrete Supply — Louisville, KY

## Company Overview
- **Industry:** Construction / Building Materials
- **Location:** Louisville, KY
- **Estimated Size:** 100–200 employees
- **Website:** bluegrassconcrete.com

## Pain Points
- Delivery scheduling for ready-mix trucks is managed via radio and whiteboards
- Batch plant operators rely on experience rather than data for mix consistency
- Fleet maintenance is reactive — trucks break down mid-route causing delays and penalties
- Customer order changes (volume, timing) communicated by phone create errors

## Proposed AI Solution
- **Route and delivery optimization:** AI scheduling that coordinates pour windows, traffic, batch timing, and truck availability for on-time delivery
- **Quality control AI:** Sensor data analysis at batch plants to maintain mix consistency and flag deviations before trucks leave
- **Predictive fleet maintenance:** Monitor truck telemetry to predict failures and schedule maintenance during off-hours
- **Digital order management:** AI-assisted order intake via text/portal that confirms changes, updates dispatch, and sends customer ETAs automatically

## Value Proposition
Reduce delivery delays by 35%, cut rejected loads by 50%, and decrease fleet downtime by 20%.

## Contact Research
- TBD — needs operations manager or dispatch supervisor contact
