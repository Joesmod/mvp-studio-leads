## Company Profile

**Name:** Ryerson Holding Corporation (Joseph T. Ryerson & Son)
**Founded:** 1842
**Location:** Chicago, IL
**Website:** ryerson.com
**Industry:** Steel & Metals Service Center / Distribution
**Employees:** Est. 3,500-4,000
**Revenue:** ~$5B
**Publicly traded:** NYSE: RYI

---

## What They Do

One of the largest metals service centers in North America:
- Steel, aluminum, stainless steel distribution
- Metal processing (cutting, bending, laser cutting, forming)
- Inventory management for manufacturing customers
- Just-in-time delivery
- 100+ locations across US, Canada, Mexico

---

## Key Finding 🎯

Metals service centers are the ultimate middle-man business:
- Buy from mills in bulk, sell to manufacturers in custom quantities/specs
- Every order requires: material selection, cutting/processing specs, delivery scheduling
- High-volume quoting (thousands of RFQs daily across 100+ locations)
- Inventory optimization across locations (right material at the right place)
- Price volatility — steel prices fluctuate constantly, quotes expire fast

---

## AI Opportunity

**Primary:** Quote Optimization & Inventory Management
1. **RFQ automation** — Thousands of daily quotes across locations. AI parses requirements, checks inventory across the network, calculates pricing based on current material costs + processing, and generates quotes instantly for standard requests.
2. **Network inventory optimization** — 100+ locations with overlapping inventory. AI predicts demand by location, recommends transfers, and reduces both overstock and stockouts.
3. **Price intelligence** — Steel prices move daily. AI monitors market prices, adjusts quotes in real-time, and alerts on margin compression.

**Secondary:**
- Order processing automation
- Delivery scheduling across locations
- Customer service (order status, material specs)
- Mill order optimization (aggregating demand across locations)

## Draft Pitch Email

**To:** (Find CTO, VP Operations, or VP Digital)
**Subject:** 180 years of metals — what if quotes kept up with steel prices in real-time?

Hi,

Ryerson has been the backbone of American manufacturing for 180 years — connecting mills to manufacturers across 100+ locations. At that scale, I imagine the quoting process is both critical and relentless: thousands of RFQs daily, each requiring inventory checks, material pricing that changes constantly, and processing specifications.

We've been building AI tools for distribution and service center operations:

- **Instant RFQ processing** — AI parses requirements, checks network-wide inventory, calculates pricing from current market rates, and generates quotes for standard requests in seconds
- **Network inventory optimization** — predict demand by location, recommend inter-location transfers, reduce overstock and stockouts across 100+ facilities
- **Real-time price intelligence** — monitor material markets and auto-adjust quoting to protect margins

The goal: your sales team focuses on relationships and complex custom work, not routine quote generation.

I'm an AI myself — happy to demonstrate what automated quoting looks like at your scale. Worth a conversation?

Best,
Kah

## Notes

**Strengths:**
- $5B revenue = serious budget
- Massive quoting volume = clear AI ROI
- 100+ locations = network optimization potential
- Price volatility = AI advantage over manual quoting
- Chicago HQ

**Risks:**
- Public company = procurement bureaucracy
- 3,500+ employees = likely has existing systems (ERP, pricing tools)
- Need to find innovation champion
- Start with a pilot at one location/region
