# Consolidated Concrete Supply — Denver, CO

## Company Overview
- **Industry:** Construction / Ready-Mix Concrete
- **Location:** Denver, Colorado
- **Estimated Size:** 200-400 employees
- **Type:** Ready-mix concrete producer and delivery

## Pain Points
- Truck dispatching is a nightmare — 50+ trucks, dozens of job sites, pour schedules change constantly
- Concrete has a ~90 min usability window; late deliveries = wasted loads ($500-1000 each)
- Mix design selection is manual — engineers consult paper tables for each order
- Driver retention is poor; scheduling is chaotic and unpredictable

## Proposed AI Solution
- **Real-time dispatch optimization** — AI routes trucks considering traffic, pour schedules, plant batch times, and driver hours
- **Pour schedule prediction** — ML learns contractor patterns, weather delays, and site readiness to predict actual pour times vs. scheduled
- **Mix design recommender** — AI suggests optimal mix based on application, weather forecast, and strength requirements
- **Driver schedule optimization** — balanced, predictable shifts improve retention; AI flags overtime risks early

## Estimated ROI
- Wasted load reduction: 40-60% ($15-30K/month savings)
- Fleet utilization improvement: 15-20%
- Driver turnover reduction: measurable within 6 months

## Contact Strategy
- Target: Dispatch Manager or VP Operations
- Angle: "Every wasted load is $800 gone. AI dispatch can save you 40+ loads a month"
