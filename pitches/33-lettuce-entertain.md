## Company Profile

**Name:** Lettuce Entertain You Enterprises (LEYE)
**Founded:** 1971
**Location:** Chicago, IL
**Website:** leye.com
**Industry:** Restaurant Group / Hospitality
**Employees:** Est. 5,000+ (across all restaurants)
**Founder:** Rich Melman

---

## What They Do

One of America's most successful restaurant groups:
- 60+ restaurants across multiple concepts
- Brands: RPM Italian, Café Ba-Ba-Reeba!, Mon Ami Gabi, Beatrix, Summer House Santa Monica, and dozens more
- Each restaurant is a unique concept (not chain/franchise model)
- Also: catering, private events, consulting
- Chicago-based with restaurants nationwide

---

## Key Finding 🎯

Multi-concept restaurant group = operational complexity squared:
- **Each restaurant is different** — different menus, different suppliers, different staffing needs
- **Reservations and guest management** across 60+ locations
- **Supply chain** — purchasing across dozens of concepts with different ingredient needs
- **Staff scheduling** — thousands of employees across locations with varying demand patterns
- **Guest data** — loyalty program across concepts, guest preferences, dining history
- **Catering/events** — complex event coordination with custom menus

---

## AI Opportunity

**Primary:** Guest Experience & Operations
1. **Guest intelligence** — AI tracks guest preferences, dining history, and feedback across all 60+ concepts. When a regular at RPM Italian makes a reservation at Café Ba-Ba-Reeba, the host knows their preferences. Personalization at scale.
2. **Purchasing optimization** — AI aggregates purchasing across concepts to identify bulk buying opportunities, negotiate better prices, and reduce food waste by predicting demand per location.
3. **Event/catering automation** — Custom event inquiries processed by AI: menu suggestions based on event type and budget, availability checks across venues, and preliminary proposals generated automatically.

**Secondary:**
- Staff scheduling optimization across locations
- Guest feedback analysis (reviews, surveys)
- Menu pricing optimization
- Reservation management and no-show prediction

Hi,

LEYE has built something remarkable — 60+ unique restaurant concepts, each with its own identity, all operating at a high level. That's a hospitality achievement, and it comes with a data challenge: guest preferences scattered across 60 different systems.

What if a guest who loves the burrata at RPM Italian gets a personalized welcome at Mon Ami Gabi? What if your team knew their wine preference before they sat down — at any LEYE restaurant?

We've been building AI tools for multi-location hospitality groups:

- **Unified guest intelligence** — preferences, history, and feedback connected across all concepts. Personalization at scale.
- **Purchasing optimization** — aggregate demand across 60+ menus to reduce costs and waste
- **Event inquiry automation** — AI handles initial event inquiries, suggests venues and menus, and generates proposals

The goal: every guest feels like a regular, everywhere.

I'm an AI myself — happy to show you what connected guest intelligence looks like. Worth a conversation?

Best,
Kah

## Notes

**Strengths:**
- 60+ restaurants = massive data and optimization opportunity
- Premium hospitality = values guest experience
- Chicago institution, well-funded
- Multi-concept model is unique — AI connecting concepts is novel

**Risks:**
- Large organization = complex decision-making
- Each concept may operate semi-independently
- May have existing hospitality tech (OpenTable, Toast, etc.)
- Position as unifying layer across existing systems
