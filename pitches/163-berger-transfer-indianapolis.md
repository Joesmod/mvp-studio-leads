### Pain Points
- Route optimization for long-haul and local moves done manually
- Estimating move costs requires in-person surveys — time-consuming and inconsistent
- Warehouse space utilization tracking is spreadsheet-based

### Proposed AI Solution
AI-powered **virtual move estimator** using photo/video upload — customers snap pics of their home, AI estimates volume, weight, and cost. Plus route optimization engine that factors in fuel costs, driver hours, and delivery windows.

### Why Now
Moving industry is ripe for disruption. Companies still doing pen-and-paper estimates are losing to tech-forward competitors.
