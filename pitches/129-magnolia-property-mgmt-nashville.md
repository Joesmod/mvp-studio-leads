# Magnolia Property Management — Nashville, TN

## Company Overview
- **Industry:** Real Estate / Property Management
- **Location:** Nashville, Tennessee
- **Estimated Size:** 50-120 employees
- **Type:** Residential and commercial property management (2,000+ units)

## Pain Points
- Tenant communication is overwhelmed — maintenance requests via phone, email, text, and portal with no unified triage
- Lease renewals are reactive; tenants leave before anyone reaches out
- Vendor coordination for maintenance is manual — finding available, affordable contractors is time-consuming
- Rent collection follow-up is manual and awkward for property managers

## Proposed AI Solution
- **AI maintenance triage** — chatbot receives requests across all channels, categorizes urgency, auto-dispatches for routine issues
- **Predictive lease renewal** — AI identifies flight-risk tenants 90 days out based on payment patterns, maintenance history, and market comps; triggers retention offers
- **Smart vendor matching** — AI selects vendors based on availability, cost history, tenant ratings, and proximity
- **Automated collections workflow** — AI sends graduated reminders, offers payment plans, escalates only when needed

## Estimated ROI
- Maintenance response time: from 24h to 2h for urgent issues
- Tenant retention improvement: 10-15%
- Staff time saved on routine communications: 30+ hours/week

## Contact Strategy
- Target: Owner or Director of Operations
- Angle: "Happy tenants stay longer. AI handles the noise so your team can focus on the relationships that matter"
