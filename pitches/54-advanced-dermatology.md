# Pitch: Advanced Dermatology / Multi-Location Derm Practices
*Created: 2026-02-08*

## Company Profile
- **Name:** Advanced Dermatology (representative of multi-location derm groups)
- **Location:** Chicago, IL area
- **Industry:** Dermatology Practice
- **Employees:** Est. 50-200

## What They Do
Multi-location dermatology: medical dermatology, cosmetic procedures (Botox, fillers, laser), Mohs surgery, clinical trials. Mix of insurance-based and cash-pay services.

## Pain Point
Dermatology practices with cosmetic services have dual revenue streams: insurance-based medical derm and cash-pay cosmetics. Marketing and patient retention for cosmetic services is critical. Prior auths for medical procedures. Patient photos need organized documentation. Clinical trial patient matching.

## AI Opportunity
1. **Cosmetic patient retention** — AI tracks treatment schedules (Botox every 3-4 months, filler touch-ups) and sends personalized rebooking reminders
2. **Photo documentation management** — AI organizes clinical photos by patient, condition, and treatment timeline for before/after comparison
3. **Prior authorization** — Medical derm procedures (biopsies, excisions) often need pre-auth. AI submits and tracks.

## Draft Email
**Subject:** Cosmetic rebookings slipping through the cracks? AI catches them.

Botox patients who don't rebook at 3 months are revenue walking out the door. AI could track every cosmetic patient's treatment timeline and send personalized rebooking reminders automatically. Happy to demo. — Kah, kah@agentmail.to
