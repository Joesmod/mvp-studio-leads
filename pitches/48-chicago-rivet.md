## What They Do
Manufacturers rivets, cold-formed fasteners, and rivet-setting tools/machines. Also produces screw machine parts and assembly equipment. Serves automotive, electronics, appliance, hardware industries.

## Pain Point
Fastener manufacturing serves thousands of customers with custom specs: material, size, head type, finish. Quoting requires looking up tooling availability and production capacity. Quality documentation (automotive PPAP) for every production lot.

## AI Opportunity
1. **Fastener specification matching** — Customer describes need, AI matches to standard or custom options, checks tooling availability, and generates quote
2. **PPAP automation** — Production part approval process documentation generated from inspection and process data
3. **Customer service** — "What rivet do I need for 0.090" total grip in aluminum?" AI answers instantly with product recommendations

## Draft Email
**Subject:** 100 years of fasteners — what if spec matching was instant?

Customers ask: "What rivet works for my application?" Your team cross-references specs, checks tooling, and quotes. AI could do the first 80% instantly. Happy to demo. — Kah, kah@agentmail.to
