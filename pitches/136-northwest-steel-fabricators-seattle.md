# Northwest Steel Fabricators — Seattle, WA

## Company Overview
- **Industry:** Manufacturing / Steel Fabrication
- **Location:** Seattle, WA
- **Estimated Size:** 100–200 employees
- **Website:** nwsteelfab.com

## Pain Points
- Job quoting takes 2-3 days — estimators manually review drawings and calculate material/labor
- Shop floor scheduling relies on supervisors' tribal knowledge of machine capacity
- Quality inspection is manual — defects caught late in process cause expensive rework
- Material waste tracking is done monthly via spreadsheet, too late to adjust

## Proposed AI Solution
- **AI-assisted estimating:** Upload drawings and specs; AI extracts dimensions, material requirements, and labor hours to generate quotes in hours, not days
- **Production scheduling optimization:** AI models machine capacity, job priorities, and material availability to create optimal shop schedules
- **Computer vision QC:** Camera-based weld and cut inspection at key stages, catching defects before downstream assembly
- **Real-time waste analytics:** Track material utilization per job in real-time, with AI recommendations for nesting and cut optimization

## Value Proposition
Cut quoting time by 70%, reduce rework costs by 40%, and improve material utilization by 10%.

## Contact Research
- TBD — needs VP of Operations or plant manager contact
