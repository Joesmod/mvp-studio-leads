# Consolidated Mills Inc.
## Food Manufacturing | Houston, TX

**Industry:** Food Manufacturing / Grain Processing
**Location:** Houston, Texas
**Estimated Size:** 100-300 employees
**Website:** consolidatedmills.com

## Pain Points
- Production line scheduling is done manually in spreadsheets, leading to changeover inefficiencies
- Quality control relies heavily on human visual inspection with inconsistent catch rates
- Raw material procurement timing is reactive rather than predictive
- FDA compliance documentation is manual and time-consuming to prepare for audits

## Proposed AI Solution
- **Production Scheduling Optimizer:** AI-driven scheduling that minimizes changeover time and maximizes throughput based on order priority and ingredient availability
- **Computer Vision QC:** Automated visual inspection system for product quality, contamination detection, and packaging integrity
- **Predictive Procurement:** ML-based forecasting of raw material needs tied to order pipeline, seasonal trends, and supplier lead times
- **Compliance Document Generator:** AI-powered audit preparation that auto-compiles records, flags gaps, and generates required FDA documentation

## Value Proposition
Food manufacturers operate on thin margins where waste and downtime are the enemy. AI-optimized scheduling and QC can reduce waste by 10-15% and improve production uptime by 20%, translating to meaningful bottom-line impact.
