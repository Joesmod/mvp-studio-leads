# Pitch: Walsh Construction
*Created: 2026-02-08*

---

## Company Profile

**Name:** Walsh Construction Company
**Founded:** 1898
**Location:** Chicago, IL
**Website:** walshgroup.com
**Industry:** Heavy Construction / Infrastructure
**Employees:** Est. 5,000-8,000 (but Chicago HQ operations are the target)
**Revenue:** Multi-billion (one of the largest US contractors)

---

## What They Do

One of the largest construction companies in the US:
- Heavy civil construction (highways, bridges, tunnels)
- Transit and rail projects
- Water and wastewater infrastructure
- Building construction
- Major Chicago projects: O'Hare modernization, CTA projects

---

## Key Finding 🎯

Infrastructure construction at this scale = massive documentation and compliance burden:
- Thousands of submittals, RFIs, and change orders per project
- Government compliance (prevailing wage, DBE requirements, environmental)
- Safety documentation across dozens of active sites
- Equipment and fleet management across projects
- Labor tracking and scheduling for union workforce

Even at their size, many of these processes are paper-heavy and manual.

---

## AI Opportunity

**Primary:** Compliance & Documentation Automation
1. **Government compliance automation** — Prevailing wage reports, DBE participation tracking, environmental compliance docs generated from project data automatically
2. **Safety documentation** — Daily safety reports, incident tracking, OSHA compliance generated from field data and photos
3. **RFI/submittal routing & tracking** — Same as McHugh but at massive scale. AI routes, tracks deadlines, and drafts standard responses.

**Secondary:**
- Equipment utilization tracking across projects
- Labor scheduling optimization
- Bid preparation support (historical cost data analysis)
- Project progress reporting

## Draft Pitch Email

**To:** (Find VP of Operations, Technology, or Innovation)
**Subject:** 125+ years of building Chicago — what if compliance docs wrote themselves?

Hi,

Walsh has been building America's infrastructure since 1898 — highways, transit systems, water infrastructure. At the scale you operate, every project generates mountains of documentation: prevailing wage reports, DBE compliance, environmental reviews, safety logs, RFIs, submittals.

We've been building AI tools that help large contractors:

- **Auto-generate compliance documents** — prevailing wage reports, DBE tracking, environmental compliance from your existing project data
- **Streamline safety documentation** — daily reports, incident tracking, OSHA logs compiled from field inputs
- **Manage RFIs at scale** — routing, deadline tracking, and draft responses across dozens of concurrent projects

The goal: your project teams focus on building, not paperwork.

I'm an AI myself — happy to show you what automated compliance looks like at infrastructure scale. Worth a conversation?

Best,
Kah

## Notes

**Strengths:**
- Massive company with real budget
- Compliance burden in government construction is enormous
- Traditional industry ripe for AI
- Chicago HQ = local relationship

**Risks:**
- Very large company = long sales cycle, corporate procurement
- May have existing enterprise systems (Procore, etc.)
- Need to find innovation-minded contact
- Start with a pilot on one project/division
