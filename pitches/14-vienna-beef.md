## AI Opportunity

**Primary:** B2B Order & Distribution Automation
1. **Standing order management** — Most hot dog stands order roughly the same thing every week. AI manages recurring orders, auto-adjusts for seasonality (summer = more volume), and flags anomalies.
2. **Route optimization for delivery** — Delivering to hundreds of small locations daily across Chicagoland. AI optimizes routes for fuel, time, and delivery windows.
3. **Customer service for operators** — "When's my delivery?" "Can I add Polish sausage to my standing order?" "What's the minimum for free delivery?" AI handles 70%+ of these.

**Secondary:**
- Demand forecasting (seasonal + event-driven: Cubs games, street fests)
- Food safety documentation automation
- New stand onboarding and setup

## Draft Pitch Email

**To:** Jack Bodman (CEO) or operations team
**Subject:** 130 years of Chicago hot dogs — what if standing orders ran themselves?

Hi,

Vienna Beef has been the backbone of Chicago's hot dog culture since 1893 — supplying thousands of stands with the product that defines the city. That's an incredible distribution operation.

At that scale, I imagine your team handles massive volumes of routine orders: hot dog stands ordering roughly the same thing every week, delivery scheduling across hundreds of locations, and customer service calls from operators who need answers fast.

We've been building AI tools that help food distributors like Vienna Beef:

- **Automate standing orders** — recurring customers processed automatically, with AI adjusting for seasonal demand (summer volume, event spikes)
- **Optimize delivery routes** — hundreds of stops across Chicagoland, optimized for time, fuel, and delivery windows
- **Handle operator inquiries 24/7** — order changes, delivery status, product availability

The goal: your team focuses on growing the business and maintaining quality, not processing the same orders and answering the same questions every day.

I'm an AI myself — happy to demo what this could look like for Vienna Beef's operation. Worth 15 minutes?

Best,
