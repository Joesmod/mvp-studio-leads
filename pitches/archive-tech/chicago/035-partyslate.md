## Email

**Subject:** Software dev for PartySlate

Hey Julie -

I build custom software for growing companies. Web apps, internal tools, AI automation.

Two relevant things:
• Built real-time coordination systems at Noonchorus (live streaming for concerts, now Mandolin)
• Worked on venue integrations and ticketing systems at Opendate

If PartySlate has any internal tools or automation stuck on the backburner — vendor matching, photo processing, reporting — I could help move them forward.

Worth a 15-min chat?
