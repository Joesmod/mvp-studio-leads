**Subject:** Internal tools for LogicGate

Hey Matt -

Saw LogicGate is expanding its integration ecosystem - connecting compliance data across SaaS, ticketing, and security platforms.

That kind of growth usually means internal tooling and data pipeline work becomes a bottleneck.

I build custom software for B2B SaaS companies:
• Real-time systems at Noonchorus (now Mandolin) - event coordination across distributed systems
• Integration work with venue/ticketing platforms at Opendate

If dev bandwidth is a constraint on internal projects, worth a quick chat?
