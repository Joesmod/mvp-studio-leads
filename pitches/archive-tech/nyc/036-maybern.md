**Subject:** Software dev for Maybern

Hey team -

I build custom software for fintech companies. Web apps, internal tools, automation.

Two relevant things:
• Built real-time coordination systems for live events (Noonchorus/Mandolin) — complex state, multiple users
• Experience with data-heavy integrations (Opendate — ticketing/venue data pipelines)

If Maybern needs extra dev bandwidth for features, integrations, or internal tools, I could help you ship faster.

Worth a quick chat?
