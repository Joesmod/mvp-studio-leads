Hey Alon -

Tastewise is doing something smart — 1 trillion F&B signals into actionable intel. Campbell Soup, Kroger, Givaudan using it to ship products faster is real validation.

I build custom software for AI-powered platforms. Internal tools, data pipelines, client-facing dashboards.

Two relevant things:
• Built real-time analytics dashboards processing high-volume data streams
• Experience with client onboarding automation that cut implementation time by 50%

As you scale enterprise accounts, internal tooling for client success and data operations usually becomes the constraint.

Quick call to see if I can help?
