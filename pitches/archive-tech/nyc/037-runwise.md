**Subject:** Software dev for Runwise

Hey there -

I build custom software for hardware + IoT companies. Web apps, dashboards, automation.

Two relevant things:
• Built real-time systems for live events (Noonchorus/Mandolin) — handling device state across multiple locations
• Experience with complex data integrations (Opendate — venue systems, real-time sync)

If Runwise has any dashboard work, building integrations, or data pipelines that need dev bandwidth, I could help.

Worth a 15-min call?
