**Subject:** Software dev for Healthee

Hey Yonatan -

I build custom software for fast-growing SaaS companies. Web apps, integrations, AI automation.

Two relevant things:
• Built systems handling complex real-time data coordination (Noonchorus/Mandolin)
• Experience integrating messy third-party data sources (Opendate — venue/ticketing integrations)

If Healthee has any internal tools, data pipelines, or AI features that need dev bandwidth, I could help.

15-min call to explore?
