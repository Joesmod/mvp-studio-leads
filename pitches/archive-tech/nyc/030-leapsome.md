## Email Draft

**Subject:** Software dev for Leapsome

Hey Jenny -

I build custom software for scaling SaaS companies. Internal tools, integrations, AI automation.

Two relevant things:
• Built real-time coordination systems at Noonchorus (live streaming platform, now Mandolin)
• Integration work with complex multi-system environments at Opendate

Leapsome's expanding fast with AI features and HRIS. If you've got internal tooling, admin dashboards, or integration projects that need dev bandwidth, I could help move them forward.

Worth a 15-min chat?
