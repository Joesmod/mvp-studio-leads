# Piedmont Steel Fabricators — Charlotte, NC

## Company Overview
- **Industry:** Manufacturing / Steel Fabrication
- **Location:** Charlotte, NC
- **Estimated Size:** 100-200 employees
- **Description:** Structural steel fabrication shop serving commercial construction projects across the Carolinas and Southeast, from detailing through erection

## AI Use Case
**AI Shop Floor Scheduling & Weld Quality Inspection**

## Pain Points
- Shop scheduling is managed on whiteboards and spreadsheets — missed handoffs between detailing, cutting, welding, and painting delay projects
- Weld quality inspection is manual and inconsistent; failed inspections cause costly rework
- Material takeoff from drawings is slow and error-prone, leading to over-ordering and waste

## Proposed Solution
AI shop scheduling system that sequences jobs across work centers based on project deadlines, crew availability, and material readiness. Computer vision weld inspection at each station for real-time quality feedback. AI-assisted material takeoff from structural drawings to reduce waste and procurement lead time. Target: 20% throughput improvement, 50% reduction in weld rework.
