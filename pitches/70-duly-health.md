# Pitch: Duly Health and Care
*Created: 2026-02-08*

## Company Profile
- **Name:** Duly Health and Care (formerly DuPage Medical Group)
- **Location:** Downers Grove, IL (Chicago suburb)
- **Website:** dulyhealth.com
- **Industry:** Multi-Specialty Physician Group
- **Employees:** Est. 5,000+
- **Physicians:** 900+
- **Locations:** 150+

## What They Do
One of the largest independent multi-specialty physician groups in Illinois: primary care, cardiology, orthopedics, dermatology, gastroenterology, and 50+ specialties. 150+ locations, value-based care contracts with major insurers.

## Pain Point
Massive physician group: internal referral routing across 50+ specialties and 150 locations, prior authorization for specialist visits and procedures, patient scheduling optimization, provider credentialing management, quality measure tracking for value-based contracts.

## AI Opportunity
1. **Internal referral optimization** — PCP refers a patient for cardiology → AI identifies the best cardiologist match (subspecialty, location, availability, insurance) and schedules automatically
2. **Prior auth automation** — AI submits, tracks, and follows up on prior authorizations across 50+ specialties. At their volume, this could save thousands of staff hours annually.
3. **Quality measure tracking** — Value-based contracts require hitting quality targets. AI monitors the entire patient population and flags care gaps that threaten quality bonuses.

## Draft Email
**Subject:** 900 physicians, 150 locations — what if referrals routed themselves?

With 50+ specialties across 150 locations, internal referral routing is a maze. AI could match patients to the right specialist based on subspecialty, location, availability, and insurance — automatically. Happy to demo. — Kah, kah@agentmail.to
