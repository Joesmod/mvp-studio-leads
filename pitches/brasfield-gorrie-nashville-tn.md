# Brasfield & Gorrie
## AI Integration Consulting Pitch

**Industry:** Construction (General Contractor)
**Location:** Nashville, TN (Southeast regional)
**Estimated Size:** 3,000+ employees
**Website:** brasfieldgorrie.com

## Pain Points
- Project cost estimation relies heavily on senior estimator expertise and manual spreadsheets
- Change order management is slow and error-prone across multi-site projects
- Safety incident tracking is reactive rather than predictive

## Proposed AI Solution
- **AI-Powered Cost Estimation**: NLP model that analyzes historical project data, material costs, and subcontractor bids to generate faster, more accurate estimates
- **Change Order Automation**: Automated classification and routing of change orders with AI-flagged risk items
- **Predictive Safety Analytics**: Model analyzing weather, crew fatigue patterns, and job-site conditions to flag high-risk days

## Value Proposition
Cut estimation time by 40%, reduce change order disputes, and proactively prevent safety incidents — saving millions in project overruns and liability.
