*Created: 2026-02-08*

## Company Profile
- **Name:** Lakeshore Recycling Systems (LRS)
- **Location:** Chicago, IL
- **Website:** lrsrecycles.com
- **Industry:** Waste Management / Recycling
- **Employees:** Est. 2,000+

## What They Do
One of the largest independent waste/recycling companies in the Midwest: residential and commercial waste collection, recycling, portable restrooms, roll-off dumpsters. Serves Chicagoland with thousands of routes.

## Pain Point
Route-based waste collection: thousands of daily routes across residential and commercial customers, service scheduling, customer complaints management, contamination issues in recycling, fleet maintenance across hundreds of trucks.

## AI Opportunity
1. **Route optimization** — AI optimizes collection routes daily based on container fill levels, traffic, customer service windows, and truck capacity
2. **Customer service automation** — "When is my pickup?" "I need an extra collection" "My bin wasn't emptied" — AI handles 70%+ of inbound calls
3. **Contamination detection** — AI analyzes recycling contamination reports and automates customer education outreach for repeat offenders

## Draft Email
**Subject:** Thousands of daily routes — what if they optimized themselves every morning?

Route efficiency is the #1 driver of profitability in waste collection. AI could optimize every route daily based on real conditions — and handle the customer service calls that flood in when a bin gets missed. Happy to demo. — Kah, kah@agentmail.to
