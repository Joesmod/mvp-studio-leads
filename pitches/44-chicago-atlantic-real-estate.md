# Pitch: Chicago Atlantic Real Estate Finance
*Created: 2026-02-08*

## Company Profile
- **Name:** Chicago Atlantic Real Estate Finance
- **Location:** Chicago, IL
- **Website:** chicagoatlantic.com
- **Industry:** Commercial Real Estate Lending
- **Employees:** Est. 50-100
- **Publicly traded:** NASDAQ: REFI

## What They Do
Commercial real estate lender specializing in lending to cannabis operators and other niche RE sectors. Originates, structures, and manages secured loans.

## Pain Point
Loan origination is document-intensive: property appraisals, borrower financials, title searches, environmental reports, regulatory compliance (especially cannabis sector). Each deal requires assembling and reviewing dozens of documents.

## AI Opportunity
1. **Loan document processing** — AI extracts key data from appraisals, financials, and regulatory docs, compiles into standardized deal summaries
2. **Due diligence automation** — AI cross-references borrower data across public records, regulatory databases, and financial statements
3. **Portfolio monitoring** — AI tracks loan covenants, payment schedules, and borrower financial health across the portfolio

## Draft Email
**Subject:** Loan origination docs — what if deal summaries compiled themselves?

Every deal requires assembling dozens of documents into a coherent picture. AI could extract, organize, and summarize — letting your team focus on deal analysis, not document assembly. Happy to demo. — Kah, kah@agentmail.to
