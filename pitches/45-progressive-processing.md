# Pitch: Progressive Processing
*Created: 2026-02-08*

## Company Profile
- **Name:** Progressive Processing, Inc.
- **Location:** Chicago, IL area
- **Industry:** Scrap Metal Processing / Recycling
- **Employees:** Est. 50-200

## What They Do
Scrap metal processing and recycling: ferrous and non-ferrous metals. Buys scrap from manufacturers, demolition contractors, and collectors. Processes and sells to steel mills and foundries.

## Pain Point
Scrap pricing changes daily based on commodity markets. Buying requires on-the-spot pricing decisions. Grading/sorting scrap by type and quality is partially manual. Scale ticket management for thousands of transactions. Environmental compliance documentation.

## AI Opportunity
1. **Dynamic pricing engine** — AI adjusts buy prices in real-time based on commodity markets, inventory levels, and demand from mills
2. **Scale ticket automation** — Inbound trucks weighed, material graded, pricing calculated, and tickets generated with minimal manual input
3. **Environmental compliance** — EPA reporting, emissions tracking, and waste documentation automated from operational data

## Draft Email
**Subject:** Scrap pricing moves daily — what if your buy prices moved with it automatically?

Commodity prices shift constantly. AI could adjust your buy prices in real-time based on market data, optimize your mix, and auto-generate compliance docs. Happy to demo. — Kah, kah@agentmail.to
