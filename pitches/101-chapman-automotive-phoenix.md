# Chapman Automotive Group
## Auto Dealership | Phoenix, AZ

**Industry:** Automotive Retail
**Location:** Phoenix, Arizona (multiple locations across AZ)
**Estimated Size:** 1,000+ employees, 15+ dealerships
**Website:** chapmanaz.com

## Pain Points
- High volume of inbound leads across 15+ dealerships with inconsistent follow-up times
- Service department scheduling is manual and phone-heavy, creating bottlenecks
- Inventory management across multiple lots requires constant human coordination
- Customer retention tracking is spreadsheet-based with no predictive insights

## Proposed AI Solution
- **AI Lead Response System:** Instant response to web/phone inquiries with intelligent routing to the right dealership and salesperson based on inventory match
- **Service Scheduling Bot:** AI-powered appointment booking that handles reschedules, reminders, and upsell recommendations based on vehicle history
- **Inventory Optimization:** Predictive analytics for which vehicles to stock at which locations based on local demand patterns
- **Customer Retention AI:** Automated follow-up sequences triggered by lease expiration, service milestones, and trade-in timing

## Value Proposition
For a multi-location dealership group, even a 5% improvement in lead response time can translate to significant revenue gains. AI automation of service scheduling alone could free up 3-4 FTEs worth of phone time across the group.
