## AI Use Case: Alloy Specification Matching & Order Optimization

### Pain Points
- Engineers spend hours manually matching customer specs to alloy grades across thousands of product variants
- Production planning for custom orders is complex — balancing melt schedules, rolling capacity, and delivery commitments
- Technical inquiries from customers require senior metallurgist time for spec recommendations
- Quality certification document generation is manual and error-prone

### Proposed Solution
1. **AI Spec Matcher** — NLP tool that reads customer specs/drawings and recommends optimal alloy grades with confidence scores
2. **Production Schedule Optimizer** — AI-driven melt and rolling schedule that minimizes changeovers while meeting delivery dates
3. **Technical Copilot** — AI assistant trained on alloy datasheets and application history to handle routine spec inquiries
4. **Auto-Certification Generator** — Automated generation of mill test reports and compliance documents from production data

### Why Now
Specialty manufacturers with long lead times need AI to compress quote-to-delivery cycles and free up engineering talent.

### Estimated Value
- 50% faster spec-to-quote turnaround
- 10-15% improvement in production throughput
- ROI within 6-10 months
