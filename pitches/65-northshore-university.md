# Pitch: NorthShore University HealthSystem (Endeavor Health)
*Created: 2026-02-08*

## Company Profile
- **Name:** Endeavor Health (formerly NorthShore University HealthSystem + Edward-Elmhurst Health)
- **Location:** Evanston, IL (Chicago suburb)
- **Website:** endeavorhealth.org
- **Industry:** Healthcare System
- **Employees:** 25,000+
- **Facilities:** 9 hospitals, 300+ locations

## What They Do
Major suburban Chicago health system: hospitals, outpatient centers, physician offices, home health. Recently merged NorthShore and Edward-Elmhurst into Endeavor Health.

## Pain Point
Post-merger health system: integrating systems across 9 hospitals and 300+ locations, patient scheduling across the combined network, referral management between legacy organizations, staff scheduling, supply chain consolidation.

## AI Opportunity
1. **Patient access optimization** — AI helps patients find the right provider across the newly merged 300+ location network based on specialty, availability, location, and insurance
2. **Referral network integration** — AI routes referrals across the combined system, matching patients to specialists who were previously in separate organizations
3. **Supply chain consolidation** — AI identifies purchasing optimization opportunities across the merged system's supply chain

## Draft Email
**Subject:** 9 hospitals, 300+ locations — what if patients found the right provider instantly?

Post-merger, your combined network is enormous. AI could help patients navigate 300+ locations to find the right provider — and help your teams route referrals across what were previously separate systems. Happy to demo. — Kah, kah@agentmail.to
