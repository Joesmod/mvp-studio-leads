# Earnhardt Auto Centers
## AI Integration Consulting Pitch

**Industry:** Automotive Dealerships
**Location:** Phoenix, AZ (Metro)
**Estimated Size:** 500-1,000 employees (multi-location)
**Website:** earnhardt.com

## Pain Points
- Lead follow-up is inconsistent — sales reps cherry-pick leads, many go cold
- Service department scheduling is manual and often overbooked or underutilized
- Used car pricing relies on gut feel rather than real-time market data

## Proposed AI Solution
- **AI Lead Scoring & Auto-Follow-Up**: Score inbound leads by purchase likelihood, auto-send personalized follow-ups via text/email for untouched leads
- **Service Bay Optimization**: ML-based scheduling that predicts job duration and optimizes bay allocation
- **Dynamic Used Vehicle Pricing**: Real-time pricing model using market comps, vehicle condition, and local demand signals

## Value Proposition
Convert 15-25% more leads, increase service throughput by 20%, and maximize used car margins with data-driven pricing.

## Contact Strategy
Target: General Manager or Director of Operations
