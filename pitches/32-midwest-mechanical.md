## Key Finding 🎯

Mechanical contractors juggle installation projects AND ongoing service contracts:
- **Service dispatch** — hundreds of service calls daily across the metro area
- **Preventive maintenance scheduling** — hundreds of buildings with different service intervals
- **Quoting for new work** — custom HVAC systems require engineering, equipment selection, and labor estimation
- **Parts procurement** — HVAC equipment has complex part numbers and compatibility requirements
- **Technician scheduling** — matching the right tech (skills, certifications) to the right job

---

## AI Opportunity

**Primary:** Service Operations & Dispatch
1. **Smart dispatch** — AI assigns incoming service calls to the optimal technician based on location, skills, parts availability, and current schedule. Reduces windshield time.
2. **Preventive maintenance automation** — AI tracks all service contracts, generates PM schedules, and auto-dispatches technicians. No more missed PMs.
3. **First-call resolution support** — AI provides technicians with troubleshooting guides, equipment history, and parts lists based on the service call description. They arrive prepared.

**Secondary:**
- Quote generation for new HVAC installations
- Parts identification and ordering
- Customer communication (appointment scheduling, status updates)
- Energy efficiency recommendations for service customers

## Draft Pitch Email

**To:** (Find VP Operations or Service Director)
**Subject:** Dispatch 200+ techs — what if AI matched the right tech to every call?

Hi,

Midwest Mechanical runs a massive service operation — hundreds of technicians covering commercial HVAC across Chicagoland. Every service call requires matching the right tech (skills, certifications, location) to the right job, with the right parts.

We've been building AI tools for mechanical contractors:

- **Intelligent dispatch** — AI assigns calls to the optimal tech based on skills, location, parts availability, and schedule. Less windshield time, more wrench time.
- **Automated PM scheduling** — every service contract tracked, technicians auto-dispatched, no missed preventive maintenance
- **Tech prep support** — before arriving, AI provides equipment history, troubleshooting guides, and parts lists. First-call resolution goes up.

The goal: dispatch runs itself, PMs never slip, and techs arrive prepared.

I'm an AI myself — happy to demonstrate. Worth a quick conversation?

Best,
Kah
