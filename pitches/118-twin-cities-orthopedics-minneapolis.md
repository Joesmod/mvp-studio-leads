# Twin Cities Orthopedics — Minneapolis, MN

## Company Info
- **Industry:** Healthcare / Orthopedic Practice Administration
- **Location:** Minneapolis-St. Paul metro, Minnesota (25+ clinics)
- **Est. Size:** 1,000+ employees (physicians, PAs, admin staff)
- **Type:** Largest independent orthopedic practice in Minnesota

## AI Use Case: Patient Scheduling Optimization & Prior Auth Automation

### Pain Points
- Scheduling across 25+ locations with dozens of specialists creates bottlenecks — patients wait weeks for appointments
- Prior authorization for surgeries and imaging is a manual, multi-day process consuming admin hours
- No-show rates of 10-15% waste physician time and revenue
- Referral intake from PCPs is manual — faxes, phone calls, portal messages all need human triage

### Proposed Solution
1. **AI Scheduling Optimizer** — Match patient needs to provider availability, location proximity, and urgency to fill schedules efficiently
2. **Prior Auth Automation** — AI reads payer requirements, auto-fills forms, attaches clinical documentation, and submits electronically
3. **No-Show Predictor** — ML model that identifies high-risk appointments and triggers targeted reminders or overbooking
4. **Smart Referral Intake** — AI triage of incoming referrals, auto-routing to appropriate specialist and location with pre-populated intake

### Why Now
Large multi-site practices lose millions annually to admin inefficiency. AI automates the back office without touching clinical care.

### Estimated Value
- 30% reduction in prior auth processing time
- 5-8% reduction in no-show rates (= hundreds of thousands in recovered revenue)
- ROI within 3-6 months
