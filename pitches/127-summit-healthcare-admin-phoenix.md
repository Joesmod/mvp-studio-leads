# Summit Healthcare Administration — Phoenix, AZ

## Company Overview
- **Industry:** Healthcare Admin / Medical Billing
- **Location:** Phoenix, Arizona
- **Estimated Size:** 80-150 employees
- **Type:** Revenue cycle management and medical billing services

## Pain Points
- Claim denials run 8-12%; rework is manual and slow
- Prior authorization requests take staff 30-45 min each — massive bottleneck
- Coding accuracy depends on individual coders; inconsistency across team
- Client reporting is manual — pulling data from multiple systems for monthly reviews

## Proposed AI Solution
- **Denial prediction & prevention** — AI flags claims likely to be denied before submission, suggests fixes
- **Prior auth automation** — AI pre-fills auth forms, attaches clinical documentation, submits electronically
- **AI-assisted coding** — NLP reads clinical notes and suggests ICD-10/CPT codes, coder reviews and confirms
- **Automated client dashboards** — real-time revenue cycle KPIs pulled from practice management systems

## Estimated ROI
- Denial rate reduction: from 10% to 3-4%
- Prior auth time: from 40 min to 10 min per request
- Coder productivity: 2x throughput with AI assist
- Client retention improvement from better reporting

## Contact Strategy
- Target: CEO or Director of Operations
- Angle: "Denials and prior auths are killing your margins — AI can cut both in half within 90 days"
