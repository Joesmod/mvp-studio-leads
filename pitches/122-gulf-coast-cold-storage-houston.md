# Gulf Coast Cold Storage — Houston, TX

## Company Overview
- **Industry:** Logistics / Cold Chain Warehousing
- **Location:** Houston, Texas
- **Estimated Size:** 200-400 employees
- **Type:** Temperature-controlled warehousing and distribution

## Pain Points

- Compliance documentation (FDA, FSMA) is manually compiled for audits
- Inventory rotation (FIFO) errors lead to spoilage and client chargebacks

- **Automated compliance reporting** — pull sensor data, temp logs, and lot tracking into audit-ready reports
- **Computer vision for inventory rotation** — camera-based system flags FIFO violations in real-time
- **Workforce demand prediction** — forecast staffing needs based on inbound shipment schedules

## Estimated ROI
- Energy savings: $20-50K/month on a large facility
- Spoilage reduction: 30-40%
- Audit prep time: from 2 weeks to 2 days

## Contact Strategy
- Target: Facility Director or VP Operations
- Angle: "Cold storage margins are razor-thin — AI can turn your energy bill and spoilage rate into competitive advantages"
