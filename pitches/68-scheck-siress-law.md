# Pitch: Scheck Industries / Mid-Size Personal Injury Firms
*Created: 2026-02-08*

## Company Profile
- **Name:** Representative of Chicago mid-size personal injury/mass tort firms
- **Location:** Chicago, IL
- **Industry:** Personal Injury / Mass Tort Law
- **Employees:** 50-200

## What They Do
Personal injury and mass tort litigation: auto accidents, medical malpractice, product liability, workers' comp, mass torts. High case volume, heavy client communication.

## Pain Point
PI firms handle hundreds of open cases simultaneously: client intake screening (is this a viable case?), medical records collection and organization, lien tracking and resolution, demand package preparation, client communication ("what's happening with my case?").

## AI Opportunity
1. **Case intake screening** — AI evaluates incoming leads: accident details, injuries, liability factors, and statute of limitations to determine case viability before an attorney reviews
2. **Medical records organization** — AI processes incoming medical records, extracts diagnoses/treatments/costs, creates chronological summaries, and calculates damages
3. **Client communication** — "What's the status of my case?" "When is my deposition?" "Did you get my medical records?" AI handles 80% of client calls

## Draft Email
**Subject:** 500 open cases, 500 clients asking "what's happening?" — AI answers them.

Your paralegals spend half their day on client status calls. AI could handle "where's my case?" inquiries, organize incoming medical records, and screen new intakes — letting your team focus on case strategy. Happy to demo. — Kah, kah@agentmail.to
