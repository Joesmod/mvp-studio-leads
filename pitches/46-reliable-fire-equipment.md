# Pitch: Reliable Fire Equipment Company
*Created: 2026-02-08*

## Company Profile
- **Name:** Reliable Fire Equipment Company
- **Location:** Alsip, IL (Chicago suburb)
- **Website:** reliablefire.com
- **Industry:** Fire Protection / Life Safety
- **Employees:** Est. 100-300

## What They Do
Fire protection services: fire alarm systems, sprinkler systems, fire extinguisher service, suppression systems, inspection/testing/maintenance. Serves commercial, industrial, healthcare, education.

## Pain Point
Fire protection companies run on inspection schedules — every building they service requires periodic inspections (monthly, quarterly, annual) per NFPA codes. Managing inspection schedules across hundreds of clients, dispatching technicians, generating inspection reports, and tracking deficiencies is an enormous administrative burden.

## AI Opportunity
1. **Inspection scheduling** — AI manages inspection schedules across all clients, auto-dispatches technicians, sends client reminders, and ensures NFPA compliance
2. **Inspection report generation** — Technician inputs findings on mobile device, AI generates formatted inspection reports with code references and deficiency tracking
3. **Deficiency follow-up** — AI tracks open deficiencies, sends follow-up reminders to clients, and generates repair quotes automatically

## Draft Email
**Subject:** Hundreds of inspection schedules — what if they managed themselves?

NFPA inspection compliance across hundreds of clients is a scheduling nightmare. AI could manage every schedule, auto-generate reports, and track deficiencies to close — freeing your team to inspect, not administrate. Happy to demo. — Kah, kah@agentmail.to
