# Pitch: Testa Produce
*Created: 2026-02-08*

## Company Profile
- **Name:** Testa Produce, Inc.
- **Location:** Chicago, IL (South Water Market)
- **Website:** testaproduce.com
- **Industry:** Fresh Produce Distribution
- **Employees:** Est. 100-300

## What They Do
One of Chicago's premier produce distributors: fresh fruits, vegetables, herbs, specialty items. Supplies restaurants, hotels, caterers, institutions. Operates from Chicago's South Water Market. Family-owned since 1912.

## Pain Point
Fresh produce distribution is the ultimate perishable logistics challenge: product has hours-to-days shelf life, quality varies by lot, pricing changes daily based on supply/weather/season, customers need substitutions when items are unavailable, early morning operations (2-5 AM receiving and sorting).

## AI Opportunity
1. **Dynamic pricing** — Produce prices change daily. AI adjusts pricing based on market conditions, supply, quality grade, and remaining shelf life.
2. **Substitution intelligence** — When romaine is short, AI suggests alternatives (butter lettuce, mixed greens) matched to each customer's typical orders and preferences.
3. **Quality-based inventory management** — AI tracks incoming lot quality and prioritizes distribution: highest-quality to clients who need it, shorter-shelf-life to high-turnover accounts.

## Draft Email
**Subject:** Romaine is short — what if every customer got the perfect sub automatically?

Produce availability changes by the hour. AI could manage dynamic pricing, suggest substitutions matched to each customer's preferences, and optimize distribution by quality grade. Happy to demo. — Kah, kah@agentmail.to
