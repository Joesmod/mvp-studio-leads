**Subject:** Software dev for ALIS

Hey John -

I build custom software for healthcare tech companies. Web apps, integrations, AI automation.

Two relevant things:
• Built real-time systems for live events (Noonchorus/Mandolin) — complex state management
• Experience with venue/provider integrations (Opendate) — messy data, multiple sources

If ALIS has any integration work, internal tools, or AI features stuck in the backlog, I could help move them forward.

Worth a quick call?
