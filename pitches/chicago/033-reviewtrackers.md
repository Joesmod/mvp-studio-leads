## Email Draft

**Subject:** Software dev for ReviewTrackers

Hey Chris -

I build custom software for SaaS companies. Internal tools, integrations, AI automation.

Two relevant things:
• Built real-time systems at Noonchorus (live event streaming, now Mandolin) - high-throughput data handling
• Experience with multi-tenant platforms serving enterprise clients

ReviewTrackers handles massive review volume across locations. If you've got internal tooling, data pipelines, or automation projects stuck on the backburner, I could help move them forward fast.

Worth a 15-min chat?
