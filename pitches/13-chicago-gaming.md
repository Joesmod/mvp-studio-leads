## Key Finding 🎯

Pinball manufacturing is boutique manufacturing with complex supply chains:
- Each machine has 2,000-5,000 parts (electronics, playfield, plastics, metals, wiring)
- Small production runs (hundreds to low thousands per title)
- Passionate collector market = high customer service demands
- Complex BOM (bill of materials) management
- Custom orders and limited editions
- International shipping to collectors worldwide

Niche manufacturing with the complexity of much larger operations.

## AI Opportunity

**Primary:** Supply Chain & Customer Service
1. **BOM management & procurement** — With thousands of parts per machine, AI tracks inventory levels, predicts when components need reordering, and flags supply chain risks before they stall production
2. **Customer service for collectors** — Passionate pinball community asks tons of questions: "When is the next run?" "Can I get replacement parts?" "What's the difference between the Pro and LE models?" AI handles 80% of these.
3. **Order processing & tracking** — Limited edition runs create rush demand. AI manages waitlists, processes orders, and provides status updates.

**Secondary:**
- Production scheduling for small-batch manufacturing
- Warranty claim processing
- Dealer/distributor support

Hi,

Chicago Gaming has done something incredible — keeping the pinball dream alive by manufacturing these complex machines right here in Chicago. Each one has thousands of parts, passionate collectors waiting for the next run, and a supply chain that would give most manufacturers a headache.

We've been building AI tools that help niche manufacturers like Chicago Gaming:

- **Track your BOM across thousands of parts** — predict when you'll run low, flag supply risks before they stop your line
- **Handle collector inquiries 24/7** — "When's the next Medieval Madness run?" "Do you ship to the UK?" "Where can I get replacement plastics?"
- **Manage limited edition orders** — waitlists, order processing, and status updates without burying your team

The goal: your team focuses on building amazing pinball machines, not chasing parts and answering the same questions.

I'm an AI myself — want to see how this could work for your operation?

Best,
Kah
