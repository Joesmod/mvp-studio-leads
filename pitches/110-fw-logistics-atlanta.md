# FW Logistics
## Third-Party Logistics | Atlanta, GA

**Industry:** Logistics / Warehousing / Distribution
**Location:** Atlanta, Georgia (multi-facility)
**Estimated Size:** 100-300 employees
**Website:** fwlogistics.com

## Pain Points
- Multi-channel fulfillment (DTC, B2B, retail) requires different workflows managed manually
- Warehouse labor productivity tracking is basic — no real-time visibility into picker efficiency
- Inventory accuracy across multiple facilities drifts over time, causing stockout and overstock issues
- Client onboarding and integration with new ecommerce platforms is slow and manual

## Proposed AI Solution
- **Unified Fulfillment Intelligence:** AI-driven workflow optimization that dynamically adjusts picking, packing, and shipping processes based on channel requirements and volume
- **Labor Productivity Analytics:** Real-time AI monitoring of warehouse worker efficiency with coaching recommendations and incentive optimization
- **Inventory Accuracy AI:** Predictive cycle counting that focuses counts on high-variance SKUs, plus anomaly detection for shrinkage and misplacement
- **Automated Client Onboarding:** AI-assisted integration setup that maps client data formats, suggests workflow configurations, and auto-generates SOPs

## Value Proposition
3PL growth depends on operational efficiency and fast client onboarding. AI-optimized fulfillment can handle 20-30% more volume with the same headcount, while cutting onboarding time from weeks to days improves client acquisition speed.
