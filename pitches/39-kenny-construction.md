---

## Key Finding 🎯

Environmental/water infrastructure construction has extreme compliance requirements:
- EPA, IEPA, Army Corps of Engineers permits and compliance

- Confined space entry documentation
- Dewatering permits and monitoring
- Soil/water sampling and chain of custody documentation
- OSHA compliance for hazardous work environments

Every day on an environmental remediation site generates a stack of compliance documents.

## AI Opportunity

**Primary:** Environmental Compliance & Field Reporting
1. **Daily compliance report automation** — Field data (monitoring readings, inspection results, weather) compiled into regulatory-compliant daily reports automatically.
2. **Permit tracking** — AI tracks all active permits, their conditions, and reporting requirements. Alerts field teams when conditions are approaching limits.
3. **Chain of custody management** — Soil/water sample documentation generated and tracked from collection through lab analysis to final reporting.

**Secondary:**
- Safety documentation (confined space, hazardous environment)
- Equipment utilization tracking
- Project progress reporting
- Bid preparation for government contracts

## Draft Pitch Email

**To:** (Find Environmental Director or VP Operations)
**Subject:** Environmental compliance docs — what if they compiled themselves from field data?

Hi,

Kenny Construction handles some of the most compliance-intensive construction work — water infrastructure, tunneling, environmental remediation. Every day on a remediation site generates a stack of regulatory documents: monitoring reports, permit compliance, chain of custody for samples, confined space logs.

We've been building AI tools for environmental contractors:

- **Auto-compile daily compliance reports** from field monitoring data, inspection results, and weather
- **Active permit tracking** with condition monitoring and limit alerts
- **Chain of custody automation** from sample collection through lab reporting

The goal: your field teams focus on the work, not the paperwork. Compliance stays tight without drowning in documentation.

I'm an AI myself — happy to demonstrate what automated environmental compliance looks like. Worth a conversation?

Best,
Kah
