## AI Use Case
**AI Predictive Maintenance & Technician Dispatch**

## Pain Points
- Emergency repair calls are expensive and disruptive; most failures were preventable with earlier intervention
- Technician scheduling is reactive — dispatchers route by availability, not proximity or skill match
- Service contract renewals rely on gut feel rather than data on equipment age and failure likelihood

## Proposed Solution
AI predictive maintenance system analyzing equipment sensor data, service history, and environmental conditions to flag issues before failure. Smart dispatch that routes technicians by location, skillset, parts on truck, and urgency. AI-generated renewal risk scores for proactive contract retention.
