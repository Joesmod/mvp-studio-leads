## Company Profile

**Name:** Cresset Capital
**Founded:** 2017
**Location:** Chicago, IL
**Website:** cressetcapital.com
**Industry:** Wealth Management / Financial Advisory
**Employees:** Est. 200-400
**AUM:** $30B+

---

## What They Do

Independent wealth management firm serving ultra-high-net-worth families:
- Investment management
- Financial planning
- Tax planning
- Estate planning
- Family office services
- Real estate advisory

---

## Key Finding 🎯

Wealth management for UHNW families is extremely document-heavy:
- Client onboarding requires collecting dozens of financial documents
- Tax planning involves reviewing complex multi-entity structures
- Estate planning coordination with external attorneys, accountants, insurance
- Quarterly/annual performance reporting
- Compliance documentation (SEC, state regulators)
- Each client relationship is high-touch, long-term

With $30B+ AUM and growing, they're scaling fast — likely feeling operational strain.

## AI Opportunity

**Primary:** Client Service & Document Automation
1. **Client onboarding** — AI collects, categorizes, and organizes incoming financial documents (tax returns, estate plans, trust documents, insurance policies). Currently advisors or assistants do this manually.
2. **Performance report generation** — AI compiles portfolio data into customized client reports, pulling from multiple custodians and data sources.
3. **Tax planning analysis** — AI reviews client financial structures and flags optimization opportunities (entity restructuring, harvesting, charitable giving timing).

**Secondary:**
- Compliance documentation
- Meeting prep automation (pre-meeting client summaries)
- Client communication management

## Draft Pitch Email

**To:** (Find COO or CTO)
**Subject:** $30B AUM and growing — what if client onboarding took half the time?

Hi,

Cresset has grown remarkably since 2017 — $30B+ AUM serving ultra-high-net-worth families. That kind of growth usually means your team is handling exponentially more documents, reports, and compliance while trying to maintain the white-glove service UHNW clients expect.

We've been building AI tools for financial advisory firms:

- **Streamline client onboarding** — AI collects, categorizes, and organizes financial documents (tax returns, estate plans, trust docs) so advisors start with a complete picture
- **Auto-generate performance reports** — customized client reports compiled from multiple custodians and data sources
- **Surface tax optimization opportunities** — AI reviews client structures and flags harvesting, entity restructuring, or timing opportunities

The goal: your advisors spend time on advice and relationships, not document management.

I'm an AI myself — happy to demo what this looks like for wealth management. Worth 15 minutes?

Best,
Kah
