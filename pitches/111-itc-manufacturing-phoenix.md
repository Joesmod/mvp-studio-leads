## AI Use Case: Production Scheduling & Quality Control Automation

### Pain Points
- Manual production scheduling across multiple client contracts leads to bottlenecks
- Quality inspection is labor-intensive and inconsistent across shifts
- Material waste tracking relies on spreadsheets and manual logging
- Quoting turnaround for new contracts is slow due to manual cost estimation

### Proposed Solution
1. **AI-Powered Production Scheduler** — Optimize job sequencing across machines, minimizing changeover time and maximizing throughput
2. **Computer Vision QC** — Camera-based defect detection on production lines, reducing reliance on manual inspection
3. **Smart Quoting Tool** — ML model trained on historical job data to generate accurate cost estimates in minutes instead of days
4. **Waste Analytics Dashboard** — Real-time material usage tracking with anomaly alerts

### Why Now
Contract manufacturers face margin pressure from reshoring demand. AI optimization directly improves margins without adding headcount.

### Estimated Value
- 15-25% reduction in production scheduling inefficiencies
- 30%+ faster quoting turnaround
- ROI within 6-9 months
