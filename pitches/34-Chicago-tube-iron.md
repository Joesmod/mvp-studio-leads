*Created: 2026-02-08*

---

## Company Profile

**Name:** Chicago Tube & Iron Company
**Founded:** 1914
**Location:** Romeoville, IL (Chicago suburb)
**Website:** chicagotube.com
**Industry:** Steel & Metal Distribution
**Employees:** Est. 200-400

---

## What They Do

Metals service center and distribution:
- Steel tubing (carbon, stainless, alloy)
- Steel bar products
- Pipe and fittings
- Value-added services: cutting, bending, threading, coating
- Serves: manufacturing, construction, OEM, energy

---

## Key Finding 🎯

Metals distributors with value-add services have layered complexity:
- **Quoting** — price depends on material grade, size, quantity, AND processing requirements
- **Inventory across grades** — tubing comes in hundreds of size/grade combinations
- **Processing coordination** — customer orders raw + processed material on the same PO
- **Certification management** — material test reports (MTRs) must accompany every shipment
- **Market pricing** — steel prices fluctuate, quotes expire quickly

---

## AI Opportunity

**Primary:** Quote & Certification Automation
1. **Multi-variable quoting** — AI generates quotes factoring material grade, dimensions, quantity, processing requirements (cut lengths, bending specs), and current market pricing. Handles the common 80% of quotes instantly.
2. **MTR management** — Material test reports matched to orders and auto-attached to shipping documents. Currently someone manually pulls and attaches MTRs for every shipment.
3. **Inventory search across grades** — Customer asks: "Do you have 2-inch 304 stainless tubing?" AI checks inventory, suggests alternatives if not in stock, and provides pricing.

**Secondary:**
- Customer service (order status, delivery tracking)
- Market price monitoring and alert system
- Processing scheduling optimization

## Draft Pitch Email

**To:** (Find Sales Manager or VP Operations)
**Subject:** Steel tubing quotes — what if the common ones generated themselves?

Hi,

Chicago Tube & Iron has been distributing and processing steel for over a century. With hundreds of size/grade combinations plus value-add processing, every quote is a mini-project: material pricing, processing costs, availability checks, and delivery estimates.

We've been building AI tools for metals service centers:

- **Instant quotes for standard requests** — AI factors material, dimensions, quantity, processing, and current pricing to generate quotes in seconds
- **Automated MTR management** — material test reports matched to orders and attached to shipping docs automatically
- **Smart inventory search** — customers ask about availability, AI checks stock, suggests alternatives, and provides pricing

The goal: your sales team focuses on custom work and relationships, not routine quotes.

I'm an AI myself — happy to demo. Worth a quick conversation?

Best,
Kah

- MTR management is universal pain in metals
- Chicago-area, traditional industry

**Risks:**
